  "content":"I have written a couple of blogs on my site by now - I pick a book, try to comprehend it and share with you all of what I loved the most about it, business as usual. But this blog is different, this one is very personal! Books are not the only things you could learn from, there is a far better teacher - TIME. Time is that witty stern teacher which will never stop teaching you lessons, there is just no escaping it. Every year end we get excited to welcome the new year, we set up goals, we look forward but the year that is waving us goodbye is also the oracle, if you could just turn your gaze. But then why should you invest your time in reading my quotations? To be honest, I cannot give you a convincing answer. But based on a whim, I would say maybe reading my list gives you a map to the hidden treasures time has sowed in your path.\nPeople Humans are undeniably the most dominant species on the planet. But why? They are not the mightiest nor the smartest to ever walk on the planet. What do you think will happen if you and a gorilla are put on an isolated island? Who has a better chance of surviving? But if you put a hundred gorilla and a hundred of us, we will not only start an agricultural revolution but also domesticate the gorillas. This is what makes us most significant species on the planet, our collective strength, collective execution, collective intelligence not individual accolades. Thus, it is in the very anthropological nature of our species to be social. From our family structure, to fashion, to the idea of nation works just because we think, believe and perceive in something collectively. Humans and their relationship with each other are much more complex than gorillas but nevertheless we have one common ground - relationship make an individual stronger. Relationship make the space-time fabric in which our identity takes existence. Your relationship with your friends, family and colleagues push you to make the best version you, they keep you in check and maybe if you are fortunate enough, at times, lend you a shoulder to rest upon for all your nuisances. In a research by LinkedIn in 2017, eighty percent of high performing professionals said their professional networking is one of the most effective weapon in their arsenal.\nHere is a principle I learnt, you can use to improve your relationships – become a giver and expect nothing in return. Adam Grant, who is a professor at Warton says people behave in three of the reciprocity styles – taker, matcher and giver. Takers are highly competitive; they believe it is a dog-eat-dog situation. Givers give more than what they take, they believe the best in other people. And most people are matcher, they simply match the reciprocity style with which you will interact with them. You might argue, will it be smart to be giver in a world where you might be exploited by a taker? Yes! you will be hurt or exploited by a few takers at times, but those will be small encounters. Your yields as a giver will be far worthier than a taker in the long run. Strike meaning in every relation you have, get to know people around you better, be kind and prosperity will never leave your aid. Karma is a bitch only if you are.\nBooks Understanding. Nature has given this one ability of humans so much importance as if this was our sole purpose. Humans have the largest cortex among all primates which give us our ability to understand and function in the world. But what are we doing with this blessing? This question has scratched the inner membranes of my conscience for so long. The brain feeds on input. What will happen if instead of the episode of your sitcom, you fed it some black and white pages? You will be reborn!\nHere I was with a resolve to read to read fifty books a year. Spoilers – resolution thwarted. But it was not totally luckless. Reading a book changes the way you view the world, makes your discussions galvanizing and keeps that large cortex in best health. You cannot replace a book with a video or a blog about the topic. A writer while authoring a book needs to years of experience in the field and on top of it does research and works for months to produce the best of his / her knowledge (I do not read fiction as much). The sheer volume of hard work and determination needed to compose a book makes it charming enough. How much effort making a video needs in contrast?\nSl.no Book Title Author 1 The Autobiography of a Yogi Paramahansa Yogananda 2 Originals Adam Grant 3 Motivation Myth Jedd Haden 4 Sapiens Yuval Noah Harari 5 Astrophysics For People in a Hurry Neil deGrass Tysson 6 Micromastery Robert Twigger 7 Enlightenment Now Steven Pinker 8 A brief History of Time Stephen Hawking 9 Make Time Jake Knapp \u0026amp; John Zeratsky 10 The Iracus Deception Seth Godin 11 Give and Take Adam Grant 12 Solomons Code Olaf Groth \u0026amp; Mark Nitzberg 13 A World of Three Zeros Muhammad Yunus 14 Triggers Marshall Goldsmit 15 The Pope of Physics Bettina Hoerlin 16 The meaning of Life Emily Esfahani Smith 17 Gene Siddharth Mukherjee 18 Brain Rules John Medina 19 Gun Germs and Steel Jared Diamond 20 12 Rules for Life Jordan B Peterson 21 Big Magic Elizabeth Gilbert 22 Factfulness Hans Rosling 23 21 Lessons from 21st Century Yuval Noah Harari 24 Mindset Carol Dweck 25 Essentialism Greg McKeown 26 Lean In Sheryl Sandberg 27 Educated Tara Westover 28 Endurance Scott Kelly 29 The Last Lecture Andy Pausch 30 The power of habit Charles Duhigg 31 Man\u0026rsquo;s Search of Meaning Victor E. Frankel 32 A Sense of Style Steven Pinker Here is a list of all the books I read in 2019, arranged in order. I cannot emphasize enough about cultivating a reading habit. And if you have fragile habit endurance like me, just look an external hedge to keep yourself in check – mine is writing for my blog.\nFailure Dr. Jonathan Crane famously said, “There\u0026rsquo;s nothing to fear, but fear itself!”, and since you have no idea who he is, do google him up. Failure is not as bad as it sounds like, in fact the real enemy is the fear of failure. There is no harm in failing, there is harm in not trying. Which, I am sure you know already – and so did I. But no one told how to fight that fear, right?\nThe best suggestion I can give you is to change your worldview from fixed mindset to growth mindset. Whatever traits, culpability or difficulties you have, you can overcome it if you wish to. Your growth has a parabolically increasing functional relationship with the amount of effort you put in. I was someone who was so terrible at sports that I use to be Umpire voluntarily, just to save myself from embarrassment. But when I let go of what others opinionated about me and genuinely put in some hours, I realized I am not that terrible too, it was just my mindset holding me back.\nSame goes true for what you think of others, if you are un-affectionate towards somebody, it is most probably because you do not like a certain behavior of that person. Maybe you do not like a certain Bob because all he does is talk. But that is not the totality of Bob, it is his one behavior that you do not like to put up to but most not often we end up saying ‘You should stay away from Bob’. Isolate the person and the behavior and you will hit an epiphany that world is not a bad place and there is always a hope that people can grow.\nActions If you broadly observe what your day to day actions are, it is just of sum of habits compounded. Our brain instead of spending cognitive fuel on making decisions falls back to previously made decisions and deluge us into what is called a habit loop.\nProblem phase\nSolution phase\n1. Cue\n2. Craving\n3. Response\n4. Reward\nYour phone buzzes with a new text message.\nYou want to learn the contents of the message.\nYou grab your phone and read the text.\nYou satisfy your craving to read the message. Grabbing your phone becomes associated with your phone buzzing.\nThe loop feels inescapable. But breaking out from a habit should not always be about major changes. Jeff Olson calls it the slight edge – the small disciplines that will help you fight mediocracy. Just so that you can relate more to it, I have listed a couple of tweaks I made in my life. You can pick anything that resonates with you. These small disciplines will not show instant results but when compounded it will morph to be titanic. The slight edge that makes you a sharp knife.\nHaving a slow morning: Mornings are most productive time and if you are not using for your retrospection and self improvement; you are losing out on a treasure. To have a slow morning you need to wake up early instead of rushing into autopilot. A lot of people think it to be more difficult than it actually is. What if you had a morning 7 a.m. flight to Goa? How would you plan your night?\nPicking up a hobby: To say that I have zero artistic qualities is an overstatement. But I had declared a war with mediocrity. So, I picked up the easiest and cheapest way to sketch – pens. And if you read the first line of the paragraph again and look at the compound interest, I will say – I played a royal flush (best hand in poker).\nSat, 23 March 2019\rWed, 5 June 2019\rMake Calls: Set a time aside during your weekends just to make calls. Not only to your spouse or close friends but to your distant relatives, elderly people in your life and long-lost friends. It will make you someone very hard to forget.\nObserve I kept this section at last as this is the part that is most difficult to pour into words. To observe is absurdly-meaningful, remarkably-rudimentary and cannot be expressed without bulldozing some oxymoron. Let’s look at it this way that to understand how stars work, one needs to understand the atom similarly to understand the world, one needs to understand the mind. To concur the world, you need to concur the inner. You might think that you are in control of what you are doing with your mind and body, that you are the auctoritatis, but try to silence your mind for two minutes you will realize who is in control. Ostensibly it seems to be a very easy thing but being effortless is the most difficult task. Training a monkey to be still is easier than to train your mind not to wander off.\nAnd what will we find when we really observe ourselves? The answer is best left to curiosity.\nReferences · https://www.njlifehacks.com/give-and-take-adam-grant-summary/ · https://jamesclear.com/three-steps-habit-change · https://medium.com/@nwokedi/the-slight-edge-book-review-e7c31fe8165a · https://news.linkedin.com/2017/6/eighty-percent-of-professionals-consider-networking-important-to-career-success "},{

  "content":" Factfulness, by Hans Rosling\nSo this year, I took a bold New Year Resolution: \u0026ldquo;50 Books a Year\u0026rdquo;. Pretty crazy for a Lazy guy like me! But as I was pulling through my resolution (somewhat!) my walnut sized brain found it exceedingly difficult to remember all the wisdom a book provided. So, I thought, I should at least make a note of the top five things I learnt from the book. And then a thought occurred, why not make it public? It could motivate someone to pick up a book. I cannot blog about every book I read, but this one, definitely deserves mentioning about. So this is that personal-note-made-public. My memoir-on-Display!\nThey say, no book is read twice. When you read this book, you might not find these five inferences to be the most significant.\nHow is your Factfulness? The book is on factfulness about the world, so before beginning I would like you to take a small test. I know, right? Who the hell starts a blog with a test? But trust me, go through it in a fair manner, it will be insightful.\nIn all low-income countries across the world today, how many girls finish primary school ? 20 percent 40 percent 60 percent Where does majority of the world population live? Low - income countries Middle - income countries High - income countries What is the life expectancy of the world today? 50 years 60 years 70 years How many of the world’s 1-year-old children have been vaccinated against some disease ? 20 percent 50 percent 80 percent Worldwide, 30-year-old men have spent 10 years in school, on average. How many years have women of the same age spent in school? 9 years 6 years 3 years There are roughly 7 billion people in the world today. Which configuration will represent proper distribution? Americas[1] | Europe[1] | Africa[1] | Asia Pacific[4] Americas[1] | Europe[1] | Africa[2] | Asia Pacific[3] Americas[2] | Europe[1] | Africa[1] | Asia Pacific[3] In the last 20 years the proportion of people living in extreme poverty, worldwide, has\u0026hellip;? Almost doubled Remained more or less the same Almost halved Chimpanzees are considered very smart animals. If you get three buzzers marked A , B and C and before a group of chimpanzees and read out the question, and note down as each chimpanzee’s “answer” the buzzers she hits, you would see the chimps would score 33 % on average. But how much did you score? Is your world view just distorted or just dramatically wrong?\nNote\nThe answers are: 3; 2; 3; 3; 1; 1; 3;\nWhere do you lie? When we generally talk about other nation, we talk in a sense about ‘them’ and ‘us’. Subconsciously, it just a label we have assigned nations as developing/developed, west/rest, poor/rich. Whatever the term maybe, we have clear distinction about the world in our head. But how do this pictures in our heads compare to the reality ?\nLet us check it against the data. The following chart shows babies per women and their survival rates for all countries. Each bubble represents a country on the chart, with the size of the bubble proportionate to the country’s population. The biggest bubbles are India and China. On the left there are counties where women and many babies and on the right are counties where women have fewer babies. The higher up a country is the better the child survival rate is in that country.\nLook how nicely the world’s countries fall in to the two boxes: developing and developed. We can see there is a clear gap with just a few small population countries in between. Out of 193 countries more than 120 countries fall under the developing category including two of the most populated – India and China. In the developing countries women have more than 5 children on average and not all of them survive past the age 5. On the other hand, we have developed countries where women have fewer than 3.5 children on average child survival rate above 90 percent. Is not the world simple to understand? What’s the big deal?\nThe big deal is this picture is from 1965! Here is how the same graph looks now: There world has completely changed. Look at the bottom-left, there are hardly any countries left! Eighty five percent of mankind are already inside the box of what we labeled ‘developed’. You can see this trend not only in child survival rate but in all aspect of human lives. There is no gap. But while the world has changed, the worldview has not.\nDistribution of population based on income level.\rBut we still need some sort of sorting to make sense of the world. The old labels are no longer valid but we need the labels to focus on markets, healthcare and overall development. Instead of dividing the world into two groups we can divide it into four income levels. And this is how the World Bank sees the world. Each figure in the following chart represents 1 billion people distributed across four income levels. As you can see, most people are in the middle where they have their basic needs met.\nThink of the four income levels as the levels of a computer game. Everyone wants to move upward in through the levels with the only strange thing is that Level 1 is the hardest. Let’s play\nLevel 1: You start at level 1 with less than $2 per day. Your five children spend hours walking barefoot with single plastic bucket back and forth to fetch water from a dirty mud hole. On their way back they gather firewood to prepare the same grey porridge you’ve been eating everyday for your whole life – except during the months when the meager soil yielded no crops and you went to bed hungry. One day your youngest daughter develops a nasty cough due to indoor firewood smoke, it continues for a month after which she is laid to rest because you cannot afford antibiotics. This is extreme poverty but you keep the struggle on. Some lucky season maybe your yields are good and you sell the surplus to earn more than $2 a day. Level 2 unlocked, good luck!\nWhat life looks like in level 1.\rLevel 2: You have made it! In fact, you have multiplied your income, a couple of more dollars everyday, what are you going to do with all these money ? Now you can buy food you did not grow yourself, have adequate protein. Maybe you can save some money and buy a mattress or even a bicycle, which means it takes only half the amount to get the water from a cleaner source. You can afford to use a gas stove. Most importantly you can send your children to primary public school and they can study in your home under an electric bulb. Life is much better now. But life is very uncertain here, a single illness or a natural calamity and you are back to level 1. This is how majority of the world population live. Maybe your eldest son gets a job at the local garment factory and becomes the first in generations to bring home a salary. You somehow make it to level 3.\nWhat life looks like in level 2.\rLevel 3: Wow! You really did it! You and your sons worked multiple jobs, 16 hours a day and on weekends too and you have managed to quadruple your income to more than $32 a day. You have super impressive saving skills which lets you to buy small luxuries of life. You have a tap water at your home, stable electric line and a fridge too. Your roofs do not leak. You can have different meals everyday and have forgotten what is malnutrition. You even manage to buy a motorcycle. Unfortunately, you met an accident one day, all the saving for your children’s education went into your treatment, yet you remain in the same level. Soon all of your children start earning and for the first time your family goes on a vacation.\nWhat life looks like in level 3.\rLevel 4: Your family income is quite substantial now, a couple of dollars which changed your life living in extreme poverty, now do not make any difference in your life. Your grandchildren will have more than 12 years of education on average. You can afford a flight ticket and occasionally go out for dinner. You even have water heating systems. But you already know about this level! Since you are reading this, I’m pretty sure you live in level 4. The difficulty, when you have always known this level of income is to understand the huge differences between the other three levels. People on level 4 must struggle hard not to misunderstand the reality of the rest of 6 billion people of the world.\nWhat life looks like in level 4.\rDo we know? Look at this amazing graph, do you notice the most recent dip? The plunge in global life expectancy curve in 1960 was because 15 to 60 million people (nobody is sure of the exact number) starved to death that year in China, in what was probably the world’s largest ever man-made famine. Does the name Mao ring any bells? The Chinese harvest in 1960 was smaller than planned because of a bad season combined with poor governmental advice about how to grow crops more effectively. The local government didn’t want to show the bad results, so they took all food and sent it to central government. Within a year, the starvation drove the people mad, piles of dead bodies in the street, people were even seen biting each other off. The Chinese government kept it a secret for 36 years! Could any government keep the death of 15 million people a global secret today?\nNews and Media plays a very important role in being Factful. Without the world view it will not be possible to drive our actions to the right direction. It is very hard today to keep anything secret for very long. There are over 400 TV news channels registered in India alone. But unfortunately, these news sources also act as a filter which very often makes our worldview disproportionate. During the first outbreak of swine-flu, for over a period of two weeks until a vaccine was manufactured, it killed 31 people. If you search about it, google will give you 253,442 (at the time of writing) articles about it, that is 8176 articles per death. But during the same time Tuberculosis killed 63,066 people, with only 0.1 articles per death about it. This filter diverts our attention in a unimaginably wrong way, sets a fear in our minds disproportionately.\nEight miles underwater, in the sea-floor of pacific ocean just off the coast of a japan a “seismic slip-rupture event” occurred on March 11, 2011. Tsunami. It killed 18,000 people worldwide in a matter of hours. The tsunami was also higher than the wall build to protect Fukushima nuclear power plant. The province was flood and the world’s news floated the fear of radioactive contamination. People tried to escape as fast as they could, but 1,600 more died. Not one person in the 1,600 dead, was reported to having died from any radioactivity. Those 1,600 died because they were trying to escape, mostly old people from the physical and mental stress of evacuation. It wasn’t radioactivity that killed them, it was the fear set in their mind about the radioactivity.\nBeat up your Grandma Big pharmaceutical companies hardly do any research on malaria and noting at all on sleeping sickness which affect the poorest. Should we blame the big companies like Novartis? Maybe not the who company, but the CEO? But you might argue that in such the board members decide the direction, so should we punch the board of directors? But Novartis is a public company, which means the real boss are its shareholders, the board does adhere to the priorities of the shareholders, they can just elect a new board. That’s right! We need to blame the shareholders who want this company to spend on researching rich people’s illness so that they can get a good return for their shares. So who owns the shares? The rich? No, and this is where it gets interesting. Pharma companies are known to have steady stock prices, they do not fluctuate much with the economy and is a good option for long time investment. They are mostly owned by retirement funds. So, should you punch up your grandma? And don’t you forget the money your grandma gave you that summer, maybe you should punch yourself too!\nThe Foreign Disease\nSkin is the body’s largest organ. Before medicine, one of the worst imaginable skin disease was syphilis, which will start as itchy boils and then eat its way into the bones. The microbe that caused this unbearable and disgusting pain has different names in different places. In Russia it is called the polish disease. In Poland it is called the German disease. In Germany, the French disease; and in France, the Italian disease. Italian blamed back calling it the French disease.\nWhen something goes wrong, it comes very naturally to us to blame someone. We like to believe that things happen because some individuals have power and agency otherwise the world feels uncertain. This blame instinct derails us to focus on true development. The same thing is also true when things go really well, just that we ‘claim’ instead of ‘blame’. If you want to change the world, you have to understand it, blame instinct is not going to help.\nRocks that move Africa is lagging on average from other continents. The average lifespan of a newborn baby in Africa is 65, a staggering 17 years below western Europe. But averaging whole of Africa can be misleading – Tunisia, Morocco, Egypt have life expectancy way above 72. Each of the countries south of Sahara reduced it child mortality rate faster than a European country like Sweden. In fact the most entrepreneurial country in the world is not U.S., its Uganda. Bangladesh too have suffered its share of poverty and famines but today it produces most of the clothes in your wardrobe.\nThere is an idea that innate characteristics determine the destinies of people, countries and religion and culture. We believe that things have always been this way and things will never change. It is just that the speed of cultural change versus the spread of internet is not noticeable. Societies and cultures are not like rocks, unchanging and unchangeable. They move\u0026hellip;\n"},{

  "content":"Humans appeared on earth around 200,000 years ago but most human advancements are from the last 500 years. To put things into an evolutionary perspective it is- ‘in a blink’. The earth has been united into a single mega-ecology. Humanity enjoys comforts that were fairy tales not so long ago. The Science and industrial revolutions gave us superhuman powers. Heck, it has been 50years that we landed on the moon. But, are we happier? Did the newfound ways of life, wealth, social change translate into new find contentment? Watching Netflix makes one feel more fulfilled than cavemen gazing at constellations? We came through so many revolutions, struggled to be where we are today as a race but can we say that Neil Armstrong was more happy to see the blue planet from a celestial body than the nameless Tarzan who drew a hand-print on the wall of Chauvet Cave? Perhaps it is the most important question human race could face.\nPainting in Chauvet Cave\rEverything’s amazing, nobody is happy. In 1973, the economist Richard Easterlin identified a paradox which has since been named after him – Easterlin Paradox. The study showed that within a country richer people are happier, but overtime as their countries keep getting richer their happiness does not increase. Economics cannot be a one-dimensional entity, with more money people get a better quality of life in all aspects. Economics is like a rise in tide, it raises all boats.\nWhen humans transitioned from foragers to farmers, they increased in population, but faced more infections from breeding animals, consumed a lesser spectrum of food, and individual humans grew harsher. The spread of European empires enlarged a lot of ideas, increased collective knowledge but almost eliminated entire species like the Tasmanian tiger, the Aboriginals and Native Americans.\nThe Scandinavian nation Sweden is a secular paradise. Practically speaking, the country is elite with peaks in almost all human development graphs, but it has a famously high rate of suicide.\nA larger half (55.4 %) of the world has internet access but people are getting increasingly lonelier in an increasingly crowded world. The rise in individualism, materialism, consumerism and decadent wealth seem to have left us, spiritually impoverished, eroded our traditional communities of hearty social bonds and a sense of meaning bestowed by followed religion.\nSo, should we assume that all the extra years of life and health, all that additional knowledge, leisure and breadth of experience, all those advances in peace and safety have left us lonelier and more suicidal. Are all the talks of human progress being flimsy and not reflect ground reality? If it is, it would be humanity’s greatest joke!\nGarden of Eden. Before you start walking with pots hanging around a donkey into the oblivion, let’s look at the other side of the coin. We have always complained about the delay in arrival of your luggage at the baggage carousel, haven’t we all? But really, try to wrap your head around the fact that you just sat comfortably in an air-conditioned aluminum tube and flew thousands of miles at lighting speed piercing the clouds and not only that, there exists a cabin crew ready to cater to almost all your needs and safety. And you are cribbing? You are no less than a Greek God to people who were born just few hundred years ago. Imagine being born in the Nomadic Period (8000-6000 BC \u0026hellip;ish), California to New York would have taken you thirteen years not 5 hours and with a high chance of you getting killed on the way by the heat, an animal, your own tribe or even a bacteria. If it were up to me, I would build Churches for the Wright Brothers too!\nWright Brothers\rIn 1919 no women had the right to vote but less than a hundred years later women in all democracies around the world can choose their government – except one (and no, it is not a middle eastern country). Another area where humans have made a gargantuan leap is healthcare. Even in the early 1900s, giving birth was as deadly to a woman as having Breast cancer in the 21stcentury. You might have never heard of the name – Alexander Fleming, but he has saved countless people from an untimely death. He discovered Penicillin, a broad-spectrum antibiotic. Imagine if you were born in 19thcentury and your appendix was enlarged, you would have to go through the procedure of removing it without anesthesia, that too considering you were diagnosed correctly. Today you can through the procedure on one weekend and go golfing the next.\nOn August 6, 1945 the U.S dropped a Bomb called “Little Boy” on the city of Hiroshima – what an ironical name for uranium gun-type atom bomb which killed approximately 237,000 people. Now, over 60 years later the world has nine (officially) nuclear powered nations, with Russia possessing the most destructive - Tsar (loosely, King of Bombs). The Russians nicknamed it the Kuz’kina Mat–or what roughly translates to “We’ll Show You.” And is 14 thousand times more powerful than the Little Boy. One can very sanely argue that humankind is heading for a quick extinction. But I would like to present a rather unpopular view, that possession of Nuclear weapon has made the world a more peaceful place. The last bomb scarred the mankind so bad, that we might never think of using such a weapon again. The U.S. has already disarmed two-thirds of its nuclear warheads and is using the fuel for sustainable energy generation. Perhaps the most deserving candidate to Nobel Prize is J. Robert Oppenheimer. He was in fact nominated thrice, just never for Peace.\nOn September 2000, 189 UN members came in agreement for eight goals which would pull the lowest section of the human society out of misery. They are called the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and were planned to be achieved by 2015. Each goal had specific indicators and targets to be achieved and governments of the entire planet joined hands to pull this massive operation off. I am delighted to tell you that all of the eight MDGs are achieved! With the MDG1 (to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger) being achieved five years ahead of time. Individually to us this might not be of worthy consequence but as a race, this is a tremendous feat. Now, the MDG’s successor – the Sustainable Development Goals – are due to be adopted by world leaders. If we change our view from individual perception of happiness to a collective well-being, we are truly in the Garden of Eden described in the Book of Ezekiel, just maybe with lesser vegetation.\nCounting Happiness This does not mean that individual happiness is not a factor at all, instead we should look at what makes us truly happy and how can we quantify it. Happiness has two sides – an experiential side and a cognitive side. One way to measure the cognitive side would be to simply ask the people how they are doing. People can be asked “How satisfied are you these days?”, “What is the world possible life for you?”, “How would you sum your life as a whole?”. But you will see people often find these questions very hard, this is because they are actually hard. Often these answers are blurred by recent events, weather, current mood, etc. As Daniel Kahneman in his famous book Thinking Fast and Slow wrote that when people are asked about their experience, they tend to skew their answers towards their peak memories and not the actual cumulative sum of experiences. And we are hard-wired to remember the negative experiences more intensely. So, suppose someone listens to 20 minutes of splendid symphony which ends with a long screechy sound, he/she is more likely to give a negative feedback when asked about the entire experience.\nThis brings us to the experiential component which consists of a balance between positive emotions like elation, joy, pride, delight and negative emotions like jealousy, worry and anger. To sample the experiences, we can put up a buzzer that goes off at random times and prompts people to indicate how they are feeling. The ultimate measure would be the total weighted sum of a lifetime, obviously this is not feasible.\nEarthly Virtues World Happiness report 2016 showed that the richer the country, the Happier its people are. No wonder, with money comes security and better amenities. But there is a parity, the richer the country the more additional money its people need to become happier, but the upward graph never flattens out. And countries do get richer with time, economics is not a zero-sum game. Individual happiness again here is very subjective, suppose you wanted a bicycle and you got a mini cooper; you will be in seventh heaven. The same car for a person longing for a Land Rover will bring despair. That is why Americans with very high average income is far behind the happiness ladder, even behind low average income countries like Israel.\nAs Yuval Noah Harari in his book Sapiens wrote that unlike we mostly assume, Homo Sapiens are not the most cognitively smart species to walk the earth. But why is there only one species in the entire Homo genus(principle category of species)? Because we are the most social species. One smart Homo Erectus is nothing compared to collective intelligence of a hundred Homo Sapiens. This need for social connection also contributes to our happiness. Over the time families have gotten more and more nuclear, the younger generation is plagued with loneliness. But on the other hand, we have made the world a much smaller place too, social media has connected the world in a closed knit community. People have found companions favoring the same brand of digital cameras too, you should see the Nikon versus Canon thread over Reddit.\nBut that’s not all. There are other factors which engulf our happiness. Like security, you would not want to settle your rich and happy family in Syria right? Healthcare would also be key pillar. We have progressed in a miraculous way in this field but even if we cure ourselves of all diseases, we will give ourselves an epidemic of anger and anxiety. Contrary to popular belief, suicide rates have declined drastically over centuries. But well doing countries have higher suicide rates. First world problems? Maybe it is difficult to cope if people around you are more happy.\nChemical Romance The Biologist’s perspective of happiness gives us an entire new dimension to explore. Like all mental states, our subjective happiness is not determined by external factors but fundamental Neurochemicals. Your experiences are nothing but a complex mesh of neurons firing electricity and various biochemical substance such as serotonin, dopamine and oxytocin. In this sense nobody is ever happy by winning a lottery, getting a promotion, or finding true love. They are made happy by one and one thing only -pleasure sensation on their nervous system. Unfortunately for all the hopes of creating an eutopia on Earth, our internal biochemical systems are programmed to keep the happiness level constant. From an evolutionary perspective, the natural selections have only one agenda – Survival, it could not be more bothered whether you are gloomy potato or Joey Tribbiani.\nBut evidently, evolution has not landed our case very bad. It does allow us momentary rush of pleasures. For example, it does hand out biochemical candies as a reward for progenerating our species – orgasm. Scientists compare our biochemistry to air-conditioning system, it is programmed to keep the temperature constant, even though some events can momentarily alter the temperature but it soon returns to the specific point. That’s why some people dance in the rain, some are downright miserable, complaining about everything, while others are in the grey center of the spectrum, very stoic like myself. It is just a matter of luck whether your air-conditioning is set at 45°C or 16°C.\nLet’s consider a thought experiment. If you were given an option to be submerged in a tank with electrodes attached to your brain, constantly simulating happy drugs in your brain for your lifetime without a worry, something straight out of Matrix, would you choose it? If we are chasing happiness all the time, then why not? Is it not the ultimate goal?\nTrue Bliss Experiences and evaluations are related but imperfectly. An abundance of happiness makes for a better life, but an absence of worry and sadness does not. This brings us to the final dimension of good life – life with a meaning or purpose. Happiness isn’t everything. We can face choices that makes us unhappy for the short term but make us fulfilled for a lifetime like raising a child, writing a book (blog too counts) or fighting a worthy cause. Happiness is not a surplus of pleasant over unpleasant moments. There is one ethical cognitive element that makes the difference between viewing oneself as “slaves to a baby dictator” or “lovingly nurturing a new life”. As Nietzsche put it, if you have a why to live, you can bear almost any how. A meaningful life is extremely satisfying even if it faces extreme hardships.\nIf you look at it, happiness was never a function of time, comfort, luck or situations. Happiness is not dependent on external any factor, it is impossible to find it out there. We need to change our psychology about it. I know it sounds absurdly simple and totally delusional but is this not, what all the wise men ever said? Happiness is intrinsic. Something you cannot blame the time and people around you; it is for you to attain. Only then you are truly blissful.\nBy the way, the strange title of the blog merely stands for – Happiness. I know, sounds too fancy but I did not coin it, blame Aristotle.\nReferences Factfulness by Hans Rosling Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman "},{

  "content":"XOR is one of the most interesting logical operation but it is definitive not made for encrypting. Even using the lowest of configurations in today’s computer it can be broken down easily. Nevertheless, breaking it programmatically is a very interesting thought process.\nWhen you know the key length, it is a breeze! You just have to apply a brute force algorithm to find your plain text.\nLets first cut short the brute force method: There are 256 ASCII characters but only 32 to 127 are printable. So use a combination from the printable range only will decrease the iterations significantly.\nBut how to decide programmatically when we have successfully broken the cipher?\nThat is the real catch here. For this we will some use known statistics of English corpus. Then we will devise a scoring mechanism programmatically, scoring positively whenever after XOR operation the output is satisfying the statistics and negatively when it is not. Then the one with the maximum score will be the real output. Some of them are:\nThe digraphs cj, fq, gx, hx, jf, jq, jx, jz, qb, qc, qj, qk, qx, qz, sx, vf, vj, vq, vx, wx, xj, zx never occur in english words. Punctuation makes up to 2%-3% of the text (for short messages up to 10%) The letters E,T,A,O,I,N make up around 40% of the text (those are the most frequent letters in the english language) ['the', 'and', 'have', 'that', 'for', 'you', 'with', 'say', 'this', 'they', 'but', 'his', 'from', hat', 'not', \u0026quot;n't\u0026quot;, 'she', 'what', 'their', 'can', 'who', 'get', 'would', 'her', 'make', 'about', know', 'will', 'one', 'time', 'there', 'year', 'think', 'when', 'which', 'them', 'some', 'people', 'take', 'out', 'into','just', 'see', 'him', 'your', 'come', 'could', 'now', 'than', 'like', 'other', 'how', 'then', 'its', 'out', 'two', 'more ,these', 'want', 'way', 'look', 'first', 'also', 'new', 'because', 'day', 'more', 'use', 'man', 'find', 'here', 'thing', 'give', 'many'] are the most common words.

  "content":" A ESOTERIC PEEK AT HISTORY OF RELIGION THAT SCULPTED THE HUMAN RACE IN TIME\nWhat have we done to the world? Is it God in the making of men or men is the making of God? In the momentous history of the Earth where Human reigned the planet, men have always distinguished themselves from other groups of men by appearance, habits or dialects. Today Religion is often considered as a source of disagreement, discernment and disunion. But there has been no great unifier of men other than religion. So to really have an opinion about it, we need to be familiar with it\u0026rsquo;s history.\nANIMISM Anthropologist claim animism is observably the first form of religion Humans ever practiced. It came about right at that time when humans forgot that they were once foragers and started forming settled agricultural societies. Human norms started taking into consideration the outlook and interest of plants, animals, river and fairies. The idea of something being Sacred was conceptualized.\nSuch religion were mostly remained confined to the local tribes where they were conceived. They emphasized on unique features of specific locations, climates and phenomena. In order to give meaning to a lot of things around them they had to believe in a superhuman order that regulated the place and adjust their behavior according to it. They had their own rituals, like not to hunt white-tailed foxes or never to cut a particular tree. Humans understood that they had no control over certain things around them so, started communicating and negotiating with such beings for well being. Thus gained the idea of god. Gods acted as a mediator between human and their fate. In fact much of ancient mythology was a legal contract in which humans promised their everlasting devotion to the gods in exchange of favorable conditions. The first chapter of the book of Genesis is a prime example.\nPOLYTHEISM As time passed, Human societies grew in size, they also started trading. Thus also trading the ideas of their gods. They came to a realization that their different needs were catered by different gods. Thus giving rise to a belief system of multiple Gods, also termed - Polytheism.\nPolytheism does not necessarily dispute the existence of a single almighty or governing the entire universe. In fact, most polytheist and even animist religion recognize a supreme power that stand behind their many gods. In Greek Polytheism, Zeus, Hera, Apollo and colleagues are subject to an omnipotent and all-encompassing power : Fate (aka Ananke). Nordic gods too were doomed to perish by the hands of fate in the cataclysm called Ragnarok. Hindus which by far have the largest known plethora of Gods are also not exempted, a single principle called Parmatman is known to control every individual and every phenomenon of the Human\u0026rsquo;s and the God\u0026rsquo;s world.\nBut Hindus never constructed any temple for Parmatman, Greeks never wasted any sacrifice for fate. Why?\nThey understood that if such a power exists, it will be devoid of any interest or bias. It will be inclusive of all creation, so it is pointless to ask such a power for mundane desires like rain, victory in war etc. The only reason to approach such a power would be to know the ultimate truth and leave the cycle of rebirth, in other works to attain Liberation (Moksha) or enlightenment (Nirvana). And the only way to achieve Moksha is to renounce all desires and embrace all of the creation, the good and the bad. Some Hindus, known as Sannyasis devote their whole life in uniting with Parmatman.\nHowever most Hindus are not Sannyasis, so for their mundane assistance there are specialized gods like Ganesha, Lakshmi or Saraswathi. So polytheist had no problem accepting other gods. When they conquered other lands, they did not try to convert their subjects. The Romans, Hindus, Aztecs never sent their missionaries to foreign land and they certainly did not dispatch armies for this purpose. They un-apologetically accepted the local gods and even built temples alongside them. Thus, polytheism is inherently open-minded and rarely hand laws to prosecute infidels.\nMONOTHEISM Two thousand years ago Monotheistic brainwashing have caused most westerners to see polytheism as ignorant and childish idolatry. The fundamental difference was that, they declared worshiping all other Gods as pagan.\nIt is like if the President\u0026rsquo;s office is open to you, why would you take your problems to smaller bureaucrats ?\nThey began to believe that their god was the only god, the supreme power of the universe but possessing bias and interest. Judaism for example, argued that the supreme power was specifically interested in the tiny Jewish nation in the obscure land of Israel. But the real breakthrough came with Christianity. This faith began as an esoteric Jewish sect who sought to convince other Jews that Jesus of Nazareth was their long-awaited messiah. However, one of the sect\u0026rsquo;s first leaders, Paul of Tarsus, reasoned that if the supreme power of the universe has interest and biases, and if he had bothered to incarnate himself in the flesh and to die on the cross for the salvation of humankind, then everyone should hear about it. And this argument fell on fertile ground. This movement soon captured the entire mighty Roman Empire.\nThe only god Romans long refused to tolerate was the monotheist and evangelist god of the Christians. One might assume that the fall of (so called) Paganism and rise of Christianity would be a bloody affair. But the Roman empire did not require the Christians to give up their belief provided they obeyed state laws. But Christianity is a missionary religion, they vehemently refused and rejected all attempts of compromise. In response the Romans reacted by prosecuting them. In the entire duration of 300 years from the crucifixion of Jesus to baptism of Emperor Constantine, the Romans initiated no more then four general prosecutions of Christians, and few warlords might have been involved in some anti-Christian violence on the side. This is noting compared to the violence indited by Christians, on Christians in the next 1,500 years. The theological dispute between Catholics and Protestants turned so violent that on August 23, 1572, French Catholics who stressed the importance of good action and repentance attacked French Protestants who highlighted God\u0026rsquo;s love of Mankind. In this attack, the St. Bartholomew\u0026rsquo;s Day Massacre, 5,000 to 10,000 Protestants were slaughtered on the streets in less than 24 hours. When the pope heard the news he was so overcome of joy that he organized festive prayer and commissioned Giorgio Vasari to decorate one Vatican\u0026rsquo;s rooms with a fresco. Along the same lines in Islamic world, Muharram is observed. Anyone with the idea that if all people were to follow only one religion, it will unify the World?\nPainting by François Dubois, of the Slaughter\rBut if there is this one God, why is there no order? Why is there so much Wrong?\nDUALISM Among the most popular, monotheism and polytheism there was also the advent of a new idea - Dualism. Unlike monotheism, dualism believes that evil is an independent power, neither created by God, nor subordinate to it. This explains why the universe is constant battleground of these two forces. This explains the chaos.\nBut this gives us new line of unanswered questions, if the universe is a constant battleground of good and evil, that what is the point of Creation ? Why are the Laws of nature uniform everywhere e.g. Gravity works the same earth as it is in farthest most Galaxy. Dualistic religions flourished for more than a thousand years. Some time between 1500 BC to 1000 BC, a prophet named Zoroaster was active somewhere in Central Asia. His creed which later formed Zoroastrianism saw the world as a cosmic battle between the good god Ahura Mazda and the evil god Angra Mainyu. It was the official religion of the Persian Empire(AD 224-651). During the third and fourth centuries AD, the Manichaean creed spread from China to North Africa and for a moment it appeared it would beat Christianity. But the Manichaean lost their soul to Rome, the Zoroastrians were overrun by Muslims.\nZoorastrian Temple of Fire, Iran\rBut the Dualistic belief was not all lost, e.g. the Christians adopted the idea of Satan. But how can a monotheist adhere to such beliefs? (Which by the way is nowhere to be found in the Old Testament). Humans have an amazing ability to belief in contradictions. They even went to the extent of believing that their single omnipotent - almighty God needed their help to fend of the evil powers. (Which by the way, inspired many Jihadist and Crusades).\nOn one hand where Monotheist kicked the idea of multiple Gods out the door, they whole-heartedly welcomes the ideas of holy saints, angels and even Ghosts via the window. This simultaneous avowal of different and even contradictory ideas is called Syncretism. Which is perhaps the most popular belief!\nNATURE-ISM ? All the religions discussed so-far had one common characteristic: They all believed in personification of the supernatural power. But the history of religion does not only boil down to the history of such Gods. During the first millennium BC, religion of an entire new kind began to spread through Afro-Asia. These newcomers were Jainism, Buddhism, Taoism, Epicureanism etc.\nThis creeds maintain that the superhuman order governing the world is product of natural laws rather than divine wills and whims. The most significant in such category is Buddhism. The central figure is Siddhartha Gautama, a prince who got so overwhelmed by watching the suffering around him that he left his palace and started to meditate. After six hard years of meditating he became liberated and came to be known as Buddha (the enlightened one). He arrived at the realization that suffering is not caused by misfortune or social injustice rather it is a recipe of our mind. Even people who possess a lot, want even more, even they suffer. Therefore mind is always dissatisfied and restless. The Gods can send us rain, good harvest and lucky coincident but even the greatest of Kings might be doomed in their own grief and anguish, forever chasing greater pleasures. Buddha found a way out, he taught how to feel sad without suffering, how to feel joy without craving it, using meditation. Buddhism does not deny the existence of God but if you are content with your mind, will any God be that powerful?\nNeeds no introduction\rHowever as time passed, the followers of Buddha developed sects. Some started to believe that certain creatures and beings stop them from attaining liberation so they started to worship enlightened beings, asking them for help. Asking them for those mundane things, repeating the history again.\nReferences Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari Guns, Germs and Steel by Jared Diamond "},{

  "content":"I am not going to tell you about how to meditate or what are it’s benefits. But instead let me share with you about Habits in general, any habit.\nHuman brain uses cells called Neurons for all and any cognitive ability. An average Human has around 86 billion Neurons. They are not equally distributed in the whole brain.\nThe Prefrontal cortex of the Brain has the least density (Some thousands/cm cube). It also uses the most number of Adenosine triphosphate molecules (cellular energy molecules). Basically it is not much efficient. This part of the brain gives us our decision making power, our rationality and problem solving capability. Humans have the largest Prefrontal cortex among all animals (No-brainier).\nThe more we trace back from the frontal lobe, brain density significantly increases(to about billion/cm cube). The back of the brain handles the functions which does not require much of cognitive attention. e.g. Breathing, you do not actively need to remind yourself to take the next breathe. This part of the brain is much much efficient.\nWhen you first try anything (like learn to drive), it is very cognitively exhaustive for us. We need all focus and effort in it. Remember the inefficient part of the brain? The prefrontal lobe is at job here. This does not wanna waste more energy on the task and wants you to give up. Your own rationality will fight against your will to think of some excuse to avoid or procrastinate the task.\nBut as you fight all the resistance inside your brain with your clear vision and strong determination. The resistance will eventually surrender and the task will get easier. With enough repetition, it will be a breeze (e.g. driving after years of experience). You need not think that effort-fully to complete the task. The brain shifts this task to back of the brain(The more dense and efficient part of the brain). It does this by hard-wiring the neuron structure.\nSo if you want to form any habit do not let your rationality beat you. Just get to it. Focus of one repetition at a time that is it. It gets easier.\nSimilarly if you to break a habit bring your rationality into action. Force yourself to think instead of just doing the action. Maybe pay full attention, next time when you want to smoke.\nHope this gives you new perspective in life. This was said to me in a short conversation by Azran Osman-Rani .\n"}]
