  "content":"We are going to talk about Dopamine here - a neurochemical that has reached almost a cult status. Yes, some scientific jargon (which I will wonderfully attempt to dilute by writing within parenthesis) will be thrown for any average Melvin. But understanding this one neuro-chemical will give you more insight into the human pursuit of happiness than anything else.\nMandatory introduction paragraph, TLDR; Most experiments on fields of Endocrinology (study of hormones) or Neurobiology (study of the nervous system) are done on Rats. Come to think of it, nature uses the same language (DNA) to code all of us, a neuron (brain cell; but actually they are found all over our body) is almost identical in chimps, rodents, and homo-sapiens! Now don\u0026rsquo;t be disheartened, we have the largest and the most high-tech collection of neurons among all species, barring aliens.\nThe feelings that we hold so dear, are actually a result of chemicals circuits fired through our cells. And you guessed it right - the same chemicals are rudimentary to Rat\u0026rsquo;s feelings too (if I dare call it feeling). Among the seven major neurotransmitters (chemical messenger -released by neurons) dopamine holds a rank. But then, why obsess over this one? Because dopamine is the one responsible for allowing us to feel pleasure, satisfaction, and motivation.\nThe dopaminergic system arises from an ancient, evolutionary conserved region near the brain stem called the ventral tegmental area (henceforth called \u0026ldquo;tegmentum\u0026rdquo;).\nDopamine Pathway\rBoggling with pleasure At first pass, the dopaminergic system is about reward - various pleasurable stimuli activate tegmental neurons, getting them to release dopamine. Drugs like cocaine, heroin, and alcohol are known to release dopamine. Chronic stress or pain depletes dopamine and moreover decreases its sensitivity too - producing the defining symptom of depression - \u0026ldquo;anhedonia\u0026rdquo; the inability to feel pleasure. And that is why some people suffering from depression want to hurt themselves - pain makes them feel alive again!\nSome rewards, such as sex, release dopamine in every species examined. For humans, just thinking about sex suffices. Same for food. In primates, because we live in societies, punishing norm violations is also satisfying. Dopamine is released when a jerk is punished for breaking rules. Overbidding and winning an auction - a reward of besting someone in an intrinsic social competition also gets us dopamine. So does winning the lottery! But fascinatingly, losing a lottery has no effect while losing a bidding war inhibits dopamine release. Not winning the lottery is bad luck; not winning an auction is social subordination.\nThis leads us to another depressing finding. A monkey has learned that when he presses a lever ten times, he gets a raisin - as a result, ten units of dopamine are released. Now - surprise! - for the same activity, the monkey gets two raisins. Whoa: twenty units of dopamine are released. As the monkey gets the paycheck of two raisins, the dopamine release returns to ten units. Now reward the monkey with only a single raisin, and dopamine levels decline. This is our world of satiation where nothing is ever as good as the first time.\nUnfortunately, things have to work this way to accommodate the pleasures of both solving a math problem and having orgasms; the system must constantly rescale to accommodate the range of intensity offered by particular stimuli. The response to reward must habituate with repetition so that we can enjoy new things.\nA reminiscing thought (as if the blog needed more length) Imagine if you were a hunter-gatherer, food and weather were tough, you had no shoes nor toothpaste. A chance of getting to eat honey would be so satisfying! A life with struggles, but time to daydream and provide numerous subtle, hard-won pleasures. But now, you have hundreds of flavorful food that supply a burst of sensations, unmatched by some lowly natural food. We have over-the-counter drugs that cause spasms of pleasure, at least a thousand fold higher than anything stimulated in a pre-drug world. An emptiness comes from these sources, as these too suffer the inevitability of habituation!\nSoon we barely notice the fleeting whispers of pleasure caused by a sunrise, a spring breeze, fireflies, lingering glance of the right person, or by the reward following a difficult and worthy task. A human tragedy - the more we consume, the more we desire. What was an unexpected pleasure yesterday, feels entitled today but won\u0026rsquo;t be enough for tomorrow.\nThe thrill of a reward Back to our well-trained monkey - we now added a small light to it, that signals when to press the lever. Once reward contingencies are learned, dopamine release is less about the reward and more about the anticipation of it. In other words, for the monkey, the signaling light releases more dopamine than the raisin itself (unless of course, the reward fails to arrive, in which case, it is the most important thing in the world). But anticipation requires learning of the outcome. This explains the context-dependent craving in addiction.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take an alcoholic who has been sober for years, and return him to the alley where he use to drink and those potentiated synapses sprung roaring into action. Those cues that were learned to be associated with alcohol get initiated, dopamine surges with anticipation, and craving inundates. Can a reliable cue of an impending reward eventually become rewarding itself? Yes, it does, it is when the signal has gained dopaminergic power over what is being signaled. This is what fetishes are, both in anthropological and sexual sense.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s add a variable to our monkey\u0026rsquo;s life. Light comes on, press the lever, get the reward … only 50 percent of the time. Remarkably, once this new scenario is learned, far more dopamine is released. Because nothing fuels dopamine release like the \u0026ldquo;maybe\u0026rdquo;. This \u0026ldquo;maybe\u0026rdquo; is the propensity for addictive gambling. This is so wildly prolific that it runs Las Vegas! There is no thrill when three out of four reels line up in a slot machine.\nOne last pursuit Dopamine is not just reward anticipation; it fuels the goal-directed behavior needed to gain the reward. It binds the value of the reward to the resulting work. Motivation arises from the dopaminergic projection to the PFC (pre-frontal cortex; most logical part of your brain) that is needed to do the harder thing. It is the source behind willpower, when we delay our gratification and focus on a larger and prolonged reward, there is a gradual increase of Dopamine. The dopamine ramp-up is a function of the length of the delay and the anticipated size of the reward.\nThough the dopamine system is similar across numerous species, humans can delay gratification insanely longer. No pig restricts calories to look good in a bikini. No zebra goes through sleep deficit nights to get good scores, to get into a good college, to get a good job, and to die in better clothes. It does not end there, we use the dopaminergic power to motivate us to work for rewards that come after we are dead. Sacrificing yourself in battle so that your nation wins the war, sacrifice leisure now so that your kids inherit the money (who may or may not look after you). The extraordinary neural circuitry even has allowed some of us to care for the temperature of the planet! We might just be another type of animal, but we are a profound one.\nIn short words, dopamine is about the happiness of pursuit of reward that has a decent chance of occurring.\nReference Behave by Robert Sapolsky (largely, ahmmm\u0026hellip;.almost entirely) https://sandheepxd.medium.com/ux-design-the-neurotransmitter-dopamine-14d8f33153d "},{

  "content":"I know, it is uncanny for a male to give any take on Feminism. After all, aren\u0026rsquo;t men supposed to be vexed by the word? And women supposed to spite men for the same? Isn’t this supposed be an antagonizing topic for all right wingers? We often see women\u0026rsquo;s issues singularly as a matter of social reforms. But the stepping up of the female empowerment has much to do with the scientific advancement that does not look glorious. Let\u0026rsquo;s read about two females who are not any Hollywood Celebrity-Placard-Activist.\nThe boon of Motherhood Both the sexes are not equal. Here, I said it! Biologically. Females have been given the boon of Motherhood and with that a lot of physiological tools to support the role. This goes beyond just a flip of chromosome. I could go on about the brilliance of Human Biology but maybe that’s for another blog.\nBut the point is Motherhood is extremely costly on the female body. We have taken modern science so granted that we have forgotten that just a century ago, pregnancies were as lethal as breast cancer is today. Even now, conception post 40 becomes very risky.\nIn New York, summer of 1921, while Adolf Hitler was just a failed artist ranting in Munich\u0026rsquo;s drinking dens, two women in their forties met, together who would do more to the change the lives of women in the next century than anybody else. Their cause, however, was undeniably political. It was to give women the control over their own fertility while still letting them the enjoy the act.\nThe Wild One Margret Sanger was a feminist heroine. She was self-promoting, often disloyal and might have been a racist too. Her father was a free thinking Irish radical, but a strict patriarch at home, in a small town in New York state. Her mother a devout catholic, had no fewer than eighteen pregnancies in twenty-two years and died of cervical cancer. Margert was trained as a nurse and watched young working-class women die of botched abortions in the slums of Manhattan. I know, slums of Manhattan is a tough one to digest.\nAfter the world war, she became an anarchist and a socialist. She later focused her work on more practical issues - birth control. She was confronted by a fierce critic - Anthony Comstock. He was a postal inspector and boasted as an advocate to fight vice. He found vice everywhere - from medical textbooks to plays by George Bernard Shaw. He passed a law to prohibit circulation of any obscene or lewd material. He burned down anything that stood his way. And Sanger\u0026rsquo;s campaign on contraception options came right at his crosshairs.\nMargret Sanger\rFearing prison, she fled to Britain and even had a brief affair with H.G. Wells. It is in Europe that she had the exposure of all sorts of contraceptive theories used since ancient times, some subtle like wet tea leaves to some outlandish like crocodile dung. But none were reliable and safe.\nThe Wealthy One Katharine Dexter McCormick was a from a wealthy aristocratic family of US. The town of Dexter is named after their family. She was one of the first women to get a science degree from MIT. She was a suffragist and married another wealthy radical McCormick (nothing like the Lannister\u0026rsquo;s here). Unfortunately, her husband fell ill with Schizophrenia. And given that it is a hereditary disease, she decided not to have any children. She threw herself into a double life of a full-time caretaker and a voice for women\u0026rsquo;s campaign.\nBefore the World War, equal voting rights would have a radical thought. But the war required women also to contribute as working class. This transformed the role of Women politically. In this way could Hitler be called a Feminist too? Katharine became the chair of National Council of Defense which was in-charge of all Red Cross supplies.\nThe Mafia Duo Both of them clicked. There were women across faiths and class who wrote to them like - \u0026ldquo;I had sixteen children, of whom six are living - I am thirty seven but look fifty\u0026rdquo; and others more desperate like \u0026ldquo;If you don\u0026rsquo;t help me, I \u0026rsquo;m going to chop up a glass and swallow it tonight\u0026rdquo;. And by help, they meant contraceptives, not more advice.\nMrs. McCormick started taking trips to Europe and smuggling diaphragms to the States in her luggage. She hired Swiss women to sew thousands of diaphragms and hide them under female clothes to be transported under the noses of US and French customs. As it was the Probation period in US, she used bootleggers to transport contraceptive along with booze and deliver (not the booze) them to women through Sanger\u0026rsquo;s clinic. They both were quite the Mafia duo but not the life taking kind.\nSanger married a rich oil Baron and money was no problem. Both formidable women in their seventies funded nearly two million dollars to a brilliant mammalian egg researcher Gregory Pincus. He was famous for fertilizing rabbit eggs in test tubes. Kinda Dr. Frankenstein!\nProgesterone is a key hormone in fertilization, which ensures that the body does not produce multiple pregnancies. Pincus and his team produced a drug much more stronger than natural Progesterone that could be taken orally. It was simply called \u0026rsquo;the pill\u0026rsquo; and was commercially available by 1960s after long trials and protests. By 1965, it was estimated that a quarter of all married women under forty-five in US were taking it; by 1985 worldwide around eight million women. It still continues to be a controversial topic and religious sacrilege in many parts but if there is more impactful story of female liberty, I am all ears.\nReference https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/gregory-pincus-1903-1967/ https://g.co/kgs/MUnJFo "},{

  "content":" If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear. - George Orwell\nWorthy Tulips In the 1600s Europe spread its economic wings. It had impeccable ships that connected the world through its seaport, kind of what Dubai is doing with airports now. The sea routes then, were full of dangers like storms and pirates but the profits were huge. If anyone funded such expedition, they had the risk of losing all the money, so they developed a system to funding only a share of the expedition. This led the Dutch people invest in multiple such adventures and reap the benefits (if ship survived) without directly doing the trade. Thus born the first Share Market - in 1609 the Wisselbank opened to guarantee the rules and regulation of such coinage against a small fee.\nTulips are seasonal flowers originally grown in China but they came to Europe via Ottoman Turks. The Dutch began trading not in actual Tulips but in futures of it, betting on what the yield of the season could be ( Netherlands is still the largest flower producer of the world). This got into a business frenzy! At a point, Tulip bulbs were worth more than a house in Europe. Profits of this scale, lured investors in and in 1637, the tulip-bulb trade was worth ten times the value of Mighty Dutch East India Company - petals prized more than nations.\nRidicules, isn\u0026rsquo;t it? But is it really? We do live at a time where Chanel wallets cost more than a car. Beyond necessity, cost is just a belief system.\nWhat is China Upto? There is no doubt that China must be taken seriously as a superpower. With that money, China can do world transforming changes. It has recently introduced programable money - Digital Yuan.\nThink of it in this way, your money even if it is transacted in digital format is just made for one thing - Transactions. Beyond that, it does not offer any feature. But with programmable currency, the very nature of it makes it - well, programmable. Imagine donating to a NGO with programable money where they can just buy food with your money and nothing else. You could also program your money to be utilized within a specific date beyond that, it could incinerate itself. A technology that will allow the government to track every single penny.What about privacy? Not a question you ask is China.\nDemocratizing Everything Just a 100 years ago, democracy was rather an exception. Even though both the american continents were largely democratic but they were far from optimal. We have evolved democracy rapidly and thus evolved the world. Democracy does introduce some bureaucracy but it leads to happier societies statistically. So is democratizing everything.\nWikipedia - democratized people\u0026rsquo;s information. Imdb - democratized people\u0026rsquo;s opinions about entertainment. Github - democratizes people\u0026rsquo;s code. Crypto currencies - money.\nThere is no doubt that people want more power to themselves. We are at a pivot of transitioning into a true Global citizen. We could soon be in a future where apps, policies and economics will operate by people\u0026rsquo;s collective choice. Imagine a open source social media - where people could add a feature if they want it - it is not centrally owned so no one is selling your private information. Imagine giving tax in such a manner that your money could be spend on projects that are important to you. Cryptocurrencies are just one small step towards such a future.\nCons and Argument None of us actually understand how crypto currencies work: We do not understand money that well either, but that has not stopped us from benefiting from it. With absolute no authority there could be too much money flowing into wrong hands: Has regulated money been able to prevent this? It’s a bubble: It is a trillion dollar market now, want to bet? Towards such a future we would have such days where tulip prices are more than a Ferrari but such inconsistencies (Dogecoin?) settle overtime into a smoother line of operation.\n"},{

  "content":"We started with concepts of money, investment mindset and some rules to create wealth in the last blog. But even with that it might feel like the night before exams when considering about investing. So here is a cheat sheet so that you can sleep well and still perform good.\nBy the way, this blog is not for you:\nIf you are actually 5 years old. If you have a ton of time to pick from equity market. If your basic amenities are not met by your income. Invest the way solar systems are made Stars – You cannot have a solar system without a star. And the star must be stable enough to let the planets form, and not wiggle away by their pull. Similarly, your majority of investment should be in a low risk – stable growth bucket. These are investments that you keep for a lifetime. Fun fact: most solar systems are binary; we are an exception. Planets – They are the next significant body in any solar system, they have much less mass than their star but enough to introduce some action. Your portfolio should also contain moderately risky assets, which give you the upward growth you need for your medium-term goals. Satellites – They are present, depending upon the size of planets – smaller planets cannot support satellites. If your funds allow you with leftover funds from investments in moderately risky instruments, you can consider investing a satellite Asteroids – These are like spec of dust in terms of the size of a star, and also are extremely unstable. They keep crashing all the time and you cannot accurately predict their trajectory. But you only need a lucky one to make your wishes come true. Instrument Cheat Sheet Instruments Returns Risk Effort Ideal As Savings Account Negative None None Transactional medium Endowment Insurance Very Low None Low Secondary Star Fixed Deposits Low None None Star Bonds Low Very Low Low Star Overnight Funds Low Very Low Very low Secondary Star Liquid Funds Low Low Low Star Mutual Funds Moderate Moderate High Planet Index Funds Moderate Moderate Moderate Planet ETF Moderate Moderate Moderate Planet Thematic Mutual Funds High High Low Satellite Direct Equity High High Very High Satellite Futures High High High Asteroid Cryptocurrencies Extremely High Extremely High Moderate Asteroid You might argue that there are a plethora of mutual funds ranging from low risk to high risk then how everything be categorized as one? True but here we are taking an average assumption.\nDiversification Cheat Sheet (Age-Wise) AGE GROUP STAR PLANET SATELLITE ASTEROID 0-18 Just figure yourself out first 18-35 50% to 60% 30% to 40% 15% to 20% 0% to 2% 35-50 60 % to 70 % 20% to 25 % 5% to 15% 0% to 2% 50-60 75-85 % 5% to 10 % 0% - 5% 0% 60+ 100% Give it away if you have so much. Pick a range based on your risk taking capability. Might not always add up to a hundred. The percentage here is the amount which you want to save from your income.\nExample Case 1 Bob is a travel agent in his mid 50s. He earns around 2L a month and wants see the world for himself after his retirement. He lives minimally and is an aggressive saver. This is how he can use the cheat sheet: Out of his income he takes 30% (60k) of it for savings. Of his savings, he puts 80 % (48k) of it into stable stars like Liquid Funds. With the rest of 20% (12k) he invests in ETF for accelerated growth. Case 2 Alice is a yoga instructor, she is in her 20s and earns around 2L a month on average. She likes to spend a lot and live in the moment. Maybe this is how her diversification will look like: She puts 20% (40k) of her income into savings. She puts 50% of it (20k) in the form of Fixed Deposits for long term investment. She used around 30% (12k) of her saving into Mutual funds for medium term goals. She buys stocks with 15% (6k) of the savings. She is adventurous and puts around 5% (2k) into buying Bitcoins. Who knows, this could a multi-bagger. "},{

  "content":"Works of literature are distilled form of human perception patterns. In a way, they are more real than non-fiction. When we go through literature, we empathize with the character journey and find some parts of ourselves that we could relate to the characters. Things are not very factual in literature but so are ambiguities of life. Comics are a form of literature, why would not they be?\nMachiavellianism is the use of the general principle of \u0026rsquo;the ends justifying the means\u0026rsquo;. This means the Machiavellian person considers their goals to be of prime importance and that any method may be used to achieve them.\nAs I jaunted through the storyline of some comics, I noticed a common theme about the nature of villains. They all believe that \u0026ldquo;ends justify the means\u0026rdquo;. The villains are not stupid, or incompetent. The very line in their Machiavellian belief system that, the end that they see, should be achieved at any cost makes the difference of moral to immoral. Any terrorist also is working for a cause which he believes will serve a greater good. The oblivion of empathy and righteousness in the action to achieve a goal (however great) will make you a villain. This is the axis on which most antagonists are designed.\nThis has been the long fought thought-battle between deontology and consequentialism. This is what makes Gandhi such a popular figure, he took the path of non-violence, focused on actions rather than goals, even though it hurts to get slapped and not retaliate. If some of you hate Gandhi, then it is because of the things he did where he focused on consequence, rather than ethics of the actions. This is why Batman is the greatest hero, he has faced existential dread, veracious loss and numerous failure but he never kills the Joker. A hero looks at the virtue of his actions, consequences are anyway unpredictable. Without this will to pay the price of sticking to ethics, a hero is no good, he gives way to anarchy.\n"},{

  "content":"Seriously, am I qualified to sermon you on money? Have I made much wealth for myself? Well! not yet. But again, everything in this blog is just an amalgamation of what I, as novice have curated for my wealth management. It is about having the education on money and personal finance management. If you engineer this well, finance is going to work for you and generate enough wealth that crisis cannot shake you. But yes, the Midas touch expectation is also not healthy.\nThe Metadata Types of wealth (words that I just plucked out of my hat) Liquid: At any moment you can redeem at least the principal amount in these investment options. Such investments are essential to run your regular expenses and as an emergency fund. This is a must-have even if you have no other form of wealth. You can start such investments even if you run on pocket money also these are the safest bunch. Such investments are not meant to grow your money. The year-on-year growth rate would be near 2-5%. (Savings, Fixed Deposits, LIC, Money Bonds)\nHard: Such investments are locked-in money that cannot be easily diluted. If diluted prematurely, they might not yield expected outputs. These are your assets, and acquiring assets need huge capital. These are relatively very stable and offer a return of around 7-13% yearly. (Gold, Real Estate, Public Provident Fund, Revenue Bonds)\nMuddy: This is making wealth by trading in Equity, Debt, and Commodities market. This is less popular among the middle class because of the complexity around such commerce but they offer higher growth on much smaller capital but with a grain of salt – market Risks.\nJust some terms you should know … I guess! Dematerialized account: It\u0026rsquo;s like your savings account but instead of money, you deal in shares, equity, and commodities.\nEquity / Shares: A portion of an asset. That asset could be a corporation or a fund or a bet of the price of some commodity in the future.\nThe Magic In the barter system, if I wanted to buy a bunch of apples in exchange for sugarcanes that I have, and the shopkeeper did not have any use of sugarcanes then it was a no-deal. Thus came the concept of minting a standard form of payment across the market regulated by the law of the land – Money. In this perspective, money itself has no value, it derives its virtue from the trust that everyone places on it. Just think about it, a thousand rupee note has its value because everyone believes that its value is a thousand bucks – the moment that trust is evoked, say demonetization, you will find it is not even good for stuffing your soft toys. The money in your pocket is just a legal tender, a kind of a receipt that you can use for encashment of goods or services. Ever noticed your banknote up closely?\nNotice that is just a beautifully designed contract that has been signed by some authority. The money in your bank is even more lucrative – just a number in a database against your identity. As a matter of surprise, only 8.3% of the world\u0026rsquo;s total money is in cash, everything else is just a record against people\u0026rsquo;s identity.\nThis is perhaps mankind\u0026rsquo;s greatest invention. It gave birth to modern-day economics that is so complex that is possible for a supercomputer to predict the chemical composition of a star 50 million light-years away using a spectrometer, but not the price of Crude Oil in the next five years. But the good news is, economics is not a zero-sum game. Just like the size of our universe, the total wealth, prices of goods and services are all increasing. This means that at some point of time, there would be enough wealth meeting everyone\u0026rsquo;s need, it might not meet everyone\u0026rsquo;s greed though!\nThe Mindset The mindset is the most crucial thing that can make someone rich without being lucky. If we start talking about the psychology of money, we will have to convey such an elaborate area that the human race would build a Moon Station quicker. But we need not be an expert on it, we need just to keep some postulates in our mind to keep us afloat. So here are some points that you can simply adopt even if you are a half-wit.\nIn the longest history, the richest folks come from all sorts of professions except being an Economist. This begs me to think that people who say that they understand how money works, don\u0026rsquo;t have a clue. So, it\u0026rsquo;s a fair game for us too. There are forces other than your effort. You should take risks only when the loss is a survivable outcome. The gap between a risk-taker and a reckless baboon is in nanometers. If your desires change once you have an outcome then there is no logic in striving, you will feel the same even if you reach something else. Happiness is a result minus expectations. 81 billion dollars out of Warren Buffet\u0026rsquo;s 84 billion worth, came after his 65th birthday. His skill is in investing but his secret is time. Human minds can comprehend linear growth but not exponential growth, the power of compound is real. The only way to be wealthy is to not spend the money that you do have. It\u0026rsquo;s not just the only way to accumulate wealth; it\u0026rsquo;s the very definition of wealth. Maintain the metabolism of your spending. Desires drive you, but they also fuel your unhappiness. Progress happens too slowly to notice, but setbacks happen too quickly to ignore. You\u0026rsquo;re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity - a piece of a business - to gain your financial freedom. Worship room for error. Nothing worthwhile is free. Money is a by-product. The Mechanics Buying Equity There is a whole profession of day trading, but most of us do not have that much skill or time. Instead, you can invest in large capital, stable companies, they offer great long-term growth. For example, if you would have invested 10k in HCL technologies, in 2009 when the share price was around ₹ 25, it would have turned out to be a treasure of around 5L, that\u0026rsquo;s about 4100% profit. It has generated that much profit for the investors slowly but incrementally. There were periods of downward growth but overall, the market has gone up, you would have hit a similar multifold profit if you bought shares like Wipro, Airtel, Tata Motors, or Bajaj Finance.\nIf you look at any market index, which is an indirect measure of how the top companies are performing in the market, you will find upward growth. Sensex which you must have heard, is an Index for the Bombay Stock Exchange. And it is ever increasing.\nSENSEX Chart by TradingView\rSimilarly, for US top companies, you can also see such returns.\nSPX Chart by TradingView\rDiversify Risks Do not put all your eggs in one basket. The probability of a company failing could be substantial, but the probability for a set of companies to fail would be next to impossible. For this, you should never bet your money on a single stock. But how should you manage your portfolio? You can always borrow a managed basket instead.\nActively managed Portfolio: Someone will build a template of stocks and you will simply invest in his template, also called Mutual Funds. The simplest form of investment for a novice. Passively managed Portfolio: Nobody is managing it directly, the fund is tracking some index or sector called an ETF or Index Funds. Commodities: Apart from company shares you could also buy stakes at a commodity like Crude Oil, Tin, Gold. Have you ever seen any commodity drop in price over time? Insurance Yes, very crucial. People save a bunch of money and call it their emergency fund, especially medical emergency. This is a counter-intuitive approach. Your money should in turn produce baby money, the magic of money is in its movement, static money does not lay eggs. Buy insurance instead, it will cost you less and you will get full coverage on practically everything from your life to your flight tickets. If not, at least get term insurance for terminal illness – trust me, it will ease your peace of mind. Use your rest of the money to invest. Storing your money in a saving account is a way of slowly bleeding your money because inflation rates are higher than interest rates. Keeping cash in your locker is a grotesque homicide.\nThe Method The biggest question of all, how to go about starting at all? There could be a zillion ways but here is what working for me:\nI track my expenses. From 2016, I have an explicit track record of every penny I spent categorically. When you do it over a period, you know your spending patterns and you can trim where your expenditures are getting fat. I use an app for it, journaling my expenses under self tailored categories. The 50-30-20 rule. Whatever you earn, 50 percent of it should go to meeting your basics inevitable needs like rent, bills, and food. 30 percent of your earning should take care of your wants, this is, your not-so-necessary but necessary shopping quota. The remaining 20 percent is what I like to say untouchable money, this is strictly to earn interest – unless a financial disaster hits life. Save first, spend later. As soon as I receive my income, I subtract my 20 percent (or more) straight away into my saving scheme, my wants have a second priority. I use apps like Zerodha and Groww to manage my portfolio. Is totally electronic and reliable. For comparing options and understanding which options are correct for me, I use Tickertape. For diversifying my investments, I take the help of Smallcase. I am not worried about small market volatility; I am looking for long term returns. I am not a trader by profession, and I cannot track daily market (but the stuff is addictive) due to my professional commitments so I do not try to time the market, I inject my assets in a routinely fashion. For my saving portfolio, 30 percent is in the liquid category, 50 percent is in equity either in direct stocks or index funds which are low risks. Remining 20 percent in high-risk and high-return type equity. This bifurcation is totally up to your taste. But the wise men said, if you are in your 20s, you can have a high risk appetite because you have time to build things up again in your life. If you are in your 40s, hit the brakes on your risky assets and go for low return stable options.

  "content":"I vividly remember writing this piece up, in the same place, with same keystrokes and having same enthusiasm last year, so much so, that in my gut, I feel my past and present have somehow interlaced, conspiring against my sanity – experiencing both moments at once. We have made a complete circle around the Sun, experienced all the four seasons, yet my temporal comprehension seems to delude me into thinking 2019 was just yesterday. And when you are reading this, I know the feeling is mutual – the future and present interlaced. Here are things that I would want my future self to carry within, hope you find something for your future self too.\nDelayed Gratification The first and the best victory is to conquer self\nThe hedonists preach of ‘Live like today is your last’ is the single most damaging idea the masses have adopted. They will condemn you for structuring yourself, restraining from certain practices, being tied up tight on your rules. They will always shove you for having the best of time, now. They detest the idea of ‘discipline’; labeling it as something that does not let you live fully. These are often individuals who have never experienced the rewards of unidirectional efforts. They are slaves to instant gratification.\nI am not asking you to take this just based of my opinion. This has 40 years of research backing it. The famous ‘Marshmallow Test’ in which toddlers were given a marshmallow with no one to observe in the room. They were instructed that if they could wait without eating it, they would get another. It seems like a cruel and tough task for the kids but those who delayed their gratification were tracked down decades later for their success. The ability to delay gratification among those kids is the single most common trait that could predict their success in future.\nIf you love yourself, you will restrain yourself, structure yourself ! Because you know you deserve the best. Immediate pleasure gives away big-time rewards. You need to set order to your most mundane activities otherwise chaos will consume you. Doing things repeatedly, constructively, not stammering at any impediments, to progress towards your purpose, is the best gift you can give yourself. No athlete becomes champion is a day, no writer puts up a bestseller overnight, quality demands cost and time. If delay your gratification, decline petty pleasures, the rewards are much larger. Discipline is the highest form of self-love . And yes, no love is sailed easy.\nAbsorbing To form a reading habit was groundbreaking for me last year, my views and thoughts expanded exponentially. It was like as if a veil has been lifted before my eyes and suddenly, I knew, how much of the world was draped from me. However, I got one concept wrong, I was chasing a certain number of books I would read in the year – I thought reading a greater number means greater improvement. Contrastingly I found, that’s not how it works! Even though I read a lot (from my perspective) of books last year I could hardly recall a tenth of it and articulate even a tenth of that. So, this year, I picked only a handful of books and read it religiously, what I could not engrave in my mind by reading – I made notes about it, drew mind maps and absorbed it like a white shirt absorbs curry stains. Reading, comprehending, and then articulating is perhaps the best way to learn and if you could find someone to debate it with, it is even better.\nHere are my top three books for that I could read this year:\nWhy we Sleep by Mathew Walker: Mathew is a sleep scientist and he gave a very scientific and practical approach to get more from your life just by sleeping. He starts with the origin of our sleep cycles and how it tracebacks to our single celled ancestors and ends with how it can be a medicine in modern high paced life.\nThe Great Influenza by John M. Barry: This book is a historical account of the deadliest plague known in human history. Also known as the ‘Spanish flu’, it killed at least 50 million people. It changed the course of the first world war and in a sense gave birth to modern medical science. Covid-19 is child’s play before this.\nHappiness Hypothesis by Jonathan Haidt: It’s great, just read it.\nMortality How could I go through this year without talking about Mortality? Everyone had a wakeup call of their mortality throughout this year, but for me it was not gloomy; it was humbling. And the best way to make you realize about how I fell, is I guess through a story, a real story.\nAlexander IV of Macedonia or better known as Alexander the Great was born in 356 BC in a small tribal warring family. This was a time so long ago that even Jesus’s great grandfather was not born yet. Alexander was taught by none other than Aristotle, at age 16 he fought his first war and he succeeded his father by age 20. He started his expansion by defeating the Byzantines, and then marching eastwards. He was ruthless, fierce, had God complex, and commanded a disciplined army; he was very suspicious of his subordinates and never gave second thought to behead someone. He bought under control the much strong Persian Kingdom. It was said that his cavalry used long spears which made their appearance larger, a great handful of kingdoms simply surrendered to him just because they got frightened by the thunderous stomp of his cavalry’s disciplined march. He was unstoppable and he wanted to conquer the whole world. Although I do not find his conquests are the most profound thing about him.\nSoon his army crossed river Jhelum and defeated King Porus (current day Punjab, India). He was ready to kill King Porus and conquer the Indian subcontinent but weirdly impressed by his bravery, he let him live and even gave him a title. This was so unlikely of him, something changed in him, he stopped intruding into India. Next to him was the rich kingdom of Nanda Dynasty but instead of waging war with them, he exchanged gifts and receded his army westwards along the coast of Arabian sea. Many say his army was tiered and did not wish to continue but there are no records of mutiny. On his journey back, he did not stop in Macedonia but went to the most westward place in Babylon, the Nebuchadnezzar’s (another great biblical King) Palace. It is rumored that he met an enlightened being during his time in India and found some supernatural experience, but we cannot know for sure (although there is a mention of a certain figure named Kalanos). He soon gets sick, and this mighty raging warrior is transformed into a wise figure, humbled and embraced by mortality. He died at an early age of 32, leaving no instruction for his succession. It is his last wishes that I find so captivating, it seems like he had this divine wisdom that he wanted the world to witness.\nThe best doctors should carry his coffin: Maybe he wanted to demonstrate that in the face of death, even the best doctors in the world have no power.\nThe wealth he accumulated should be scattered along the path procession to his grave: He wanted to showcase that all the material wealth he worked so hard to gather will not be with him when he dies.\nHis hands should be let loose, hanging outside the coffin for all to see: He might have wanted to symbolize that even the greatest of power one holds will be nothing in the face of death.\nFlow Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (do not be embarrassed, no one gets it right at first; it’s mi-ha-yee cheeks-sent-me-high) wrote a book about flow and deserves a ‘Five things I learnt from\u0026hellip;’ blog by itself but let me just squeeze it here. Mihaly was a holocaust survivor and he saw that in those inhuman and unspeakable situations also, people would find happiness and when the war was over and everyone became more prosperous, people could find a way to be dull and depressed. This amused him, he dedicated his life in the research of happiness. The ad nauseum of this relentless pursuit of materialism to find happiness is not new, Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus and other philosophers have said this too, but now we have data.\nMihaly found that “a person can make himself happy or miserable regardless of what is actually happening ‘outside’ just by changing the contents of his consciousness”. He delineates that one of the ways in which we can experience happiness is to put ourselves in a state called Flow.\nIt is a state in which people are so involved that nothing else matters, self-consciousness disappears, your concentration is so intense that you have none left for irrelevant matters and somehow the sense of time seems to be distorted. If you have ever involved your self in solving a tough problem, you might have experienced it. How can you experience it on Demand ?\nBy increasing your skill and taking tougher challenges. Flow is often experienced by skilled people like rock climbers, or a master pianist, they get so engrossed in their craft they do not worry about what is going to happen tomorrow or regret what has happened yesterday, they are in the moment and that’s one of the absolutely best feeling you can have. If you take up something too challenging, you will have anxiety, you take it too easy – you will be bored. If it is neither challenging nor taking use of some hard found skill you will be in apathy, like when you are watching TV, you will breathing but will not feel much alive.\nGratitude I don\u0026rsquo;t know why but I have started appreciating the most mundane things in my life. The very water I am able to drink, how it quenches my thirst, not many people have access to clean water yet. The food that is on my table, where as 11% of the world population is malnourished. I was lucky to be born in such a place and such a time, it could have been a totally different story otherwise. And most importantly I grateful to be alive, so many died this year.\nOut of the night that covers me, Black as the pit from pole to pole, I thank whatever gods may be For my unconquerable soul.\n"},{

  "content":"Entropy and Life Entropy is the measure of disorderliness, in oddly simple terms. In a closed system, entropy never decreases. Have you ever seen a wind breeze blowing in a beach and moving the sand in such a way that it makes a sandcastle? It is because a sandcastle is a more ordered configuration of the sand particles then sand dunes, and the universe will not allow it. This is the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Each and every particle in this universe is gradually slipping into the decline of its order. Even time respects this law, and that is why you can never travel back in time, you can just have a relative experience of time. Time as the fourth dimension of our universe conserves the Second Law of Thermodynamics by never retracing back it’s path.\nBut amid this constant progression of the universe towards the disarray, nature allows small pools of temporary order which is why we see the beautiful spiral galaxies and luminescent stars. Which repeatedly forms, eliminates and forms again like the Ying and Yang, order and chaos constantly chasing one another. These temporary sets of order are not violating the Law as it is always formed at the expense of energy. The very act of writing this blog is an ordering of the alphabets decreasing the entropy but at the expense of energy.\nWhen we look at life itself, the vibrance and diversity of it makes it hard to believe what a small spec of order it is. From manufacturing all the essential elements in the core of a star, slight tilt of the earth that allows seasons to pass, to the abiogenesis itself, is just a small order swirling in the large play of chaos. Let me just throw you an example – for hydrogen to convert to helium it releases precisely 0.007% of its mass as energy, increase the number to 0.008% - and bonding would be so wildly prolific that the hydrogen would long since have been exhausted, lower the number to 0.006% and there would be no fusion, no periodic table, not even the 61 elements forming a stately clump you consider your body. If you just pause in your mind and expand your gaze on all the chain of individual fortunate and misfortunate events that has taken place for you as a being to happen. The fact that you are here, reading this is far more miraculous than anything you could have ever imagine to be written in the stars.\nInformation mrsaysgeoeand eoana nmnr o neeknestdaRm t. It does not make any sense because the letters are randomized. Things make sense when they are organized in a particular order. It z tru tht it cn b cmprsd frthr but still it is in some arrangement that it makes sense. This is called information entropy and was coined by Claude Shannon while working in bell labs. Also, it is conversely true that using information you can bring order, if you have all the information about how particles interact, you can explain any phenomenon in the universe with absolute predictability, even a coin toss. (well there are a few truly random events). But even information does not violate the second law of thermodynamics – It is very acutely explained in a thought experiment called Maxwell’s Demon.\nMusic is nothing but an order of the seven notes. Every living thing is a result of a slightly different arrangement of the four bases that constitutes a DNA. In this sense you are a distant cousin to a banana, you share 50% of your DNA with it. Neurons work the same way in your brain, as in a capybara. You are more defined by your genetics then you think. The MINNESOTA Twin study showed that identical (closest genetic relative possible) twins when reared apart and bought up is different families in different areas, showed bizarre similarities like naming their daughter / dog, similar political interest, choice of vacation to choice of profession. Each of your cell is a living thing on its own and can even be grown in a petri dish. So, what is so special about you?\nThings that we feel and know are just biochemical reactions and electrical synapses in our brain. Whatever you find meaning in, is just a comparison of the information you have. When we see a car, our brain registers that image and compares it what we know of a car from previous experiences. Information is predetermined and not random. A more daring question in this sense would be what is reality?\nNihilism The most sagacious surgery of this question was performed by Friedrich Nietzsche. His approach is rather simple – start by any random thought in your head and ask yourself Why? And whatever you come up with, ask yourself again, why? This ‘Why’ is the most destructive of all, if you ever sincerely come to think of it, you will find yourself that you cannot even convince yourself. It often puts thinkers into a state of meaninglessness and despair, an eventual existential crisis.\n“Sometimes people don’t want to hear the truth because they don’t want their illusions destroyed.”\nThe biggest truth that is out there is of Death. No one and nothing can escape, everyone and everything has to die. Whatever you do, in the end it does not even matter. Even if you build monuments and make a name yourself, it still won’t stand the storm of time and you will not be there to see it even if it does. This temporal nature of everything is mentioned in Bhagavadh Geetha as maaya.\nConsciousness Although all the above-mentioned statements are hard solid truth, it does not make it easier to digest the fact that everything is and eventually be nothing. Our existence, for a slither of time in eternity of the universe inside a small sphere of mud and water spiraling an end of an average galaxy (out of so many) feels too insignificant to comprehend. But it does not necessarily mean that it is a problem. Your life is the only thing you get to experience, if you feel humiliated - it won’t last, if you make a mistake, it won’t last and that’s - liberating! If everything is meaningless then you get to dictate what your purpose is. You can transform your existential dread to optimistic nihilism, with a grain of salt. Before you cease to exist, you get to experience and explore the world around you, count the stars, read a book and enjoy the company of a loved one. You get to decide with whatever resources you have, how to enjoy the ride.\nWhat’s special about you is that you are here, in this small planet, in this particular moment of time as a sentient, conscious being to think about your existence. You are not just a clump of cells but the experiencer of ‘self’ itself. Your cells may be replaced, you might lose an organ but you will still be you. As biology have dissected life in principles of physics and chemistry, consciousness can be dissected in a sense of \u0026rsquo;the self\u0026rsquo; and \u0026rsquo;the world\u0026rsquo;. What we experience as the world is a multi-sensory, panoramic immersive inner movie, we might as well be in a simulation like in Matrix.\nBut the world has lot to do with what’s inside. The same kind neurons that are in a cat is generating a sense of consciousness that is you all the time. And the brain is like a prediction engine. Your sense of perception is from your past experiences and the input you get, and it is a guesswork. When your perceptions get too overwhelming over your stimuli, as in the case of consumption of a Psychedelic - you hallucinate. We can say hallucination is uncontrolled perception. But then perception is controlled hallucination, in fact we are hallucinating all the time, it is just that when we all agree to it, it is called - reality. And in this reality, in the very act of asking the question - ‘Why?’ - you are seeking reasons for your convictions, you are committed to reason as the tool to justify what is important to you, and the possibilities are as infinite as your imagination. The biggest story is what we live in, spun by time, which we know as self.\nCogito, ergo sum.\nReference Forces of Nature - Brain Cox A short history of nearly everything – Bill Bryson https://hackernoon.com/rick-and-morty-and-the-meaning-of-life-6640df17e263 The Better Angels of Our Nature - Steven Pinker "},{

  "content":"\rAllow me to show you a world in some color. This is a representation of Child Mortality rate around the world. Child Mortality rate is defined by the number of children who die under the age of five per 1000 live births. Try to imagine this – If you were born in India you would share your birthday with 49,000 (rounded up) other babies of your country, and out of them 14,000, will never be able to light more then five candles on their birthday cake.\nA lot of this deaths are due to the inability of medical infrastructure and decisions. The story of a wrongful medical decision taking a life is not unheard of. Medical errors are the third-leading cause of death among Americans after heart attacks and cancer. These decisions are often not perfectly solvable – risk on both fronts. I hope you never need to take a medical decision in your life, but we all know that is a fantasy. But in case you have to, how well quipped are you? Are going to make informed strategic decisions or roll a dice? Here are a few things that will be very useful.\nThinking straight about probability If there was no uncertainty, decisions would be easy! The uncertainty exists because we do not know what future will unveil due to our decision. Cognitive Science has proven that relying on our gut or intuition is not always the best device. You can always rely on your knowledge of statistics for this.\nIf you buy one out of one million lottery ticket sold, your winning chances are one in a million. You can increase your chance of winning the lottery by a hundred times just by buying hundred tickets but it will have no real-world significance, as your winning chance will still be 1 in 100,000 which is pretty thin. You might read that accepting a particular treatment might reduce the chance of getting a disease by 50% but if you had only 1 in 100,000 chance of getting it anyway, it might not be worth the treatment. We live in a world of 7 billion and with such a large number these small percentages tend to get significance – this is called law of large numbers.\nDoctors often refer in subjective probabilities – which are neither calculable not countable but just expresses their subjective confidence in the matter for example – ‘There is a 60% chance that one rogue nation will fire an nuclear weapon in this century.’ Humans have a poor sense of what constitutes a random sequence, if asked we tend to write down far more alterations of ‘head-tails-head-tail’ and far fewer runs of ‘heads-heads-heads-heads’. This is because we think that probabilities tend to change on subsequent events, they do but not for independent events. If you are a hunter-gathering and you are looking for a fruit you ate last summer in the valley, each land area you search increases your chance of finding it in the next search – this search is a dependent event. To demonstrate this, researchers set up a university party scenario where 10% students were Engineers and 90% were not – and then explain: “You run into someone who might be wearing a plastic pocket protector or not but you cannot tell as he has a jacket on”. When asked to rate the probability that he is an engineer or not, people typically answered “Fifty-fifty”.\nYou just tested - Positive Let’s say you wake up with a blurred vision one morning. You googled it up and found that it could be blurritis. You took a blood test for it and it turns out to be positive – How serious is this? The cure is a medication called cholorohydroxelene which has a 5% chance of serious side effect – itching in your back. You can take medication for itching but it has an 80% chance of shooting up your blood pressure? How should you take a decision here?\nThe four-fold table is a easy way to visualize the information and does not require more than elementary level maths. Let’s gather few information about blurritis and proceed.\nBase rate for blurritis : 0.0001 Cholorohydroxelene side effect base rate : 0.05 The base rate of Blurritis tells that one selected at random between 10,000 might have the disease, but you are not anyone random – You tested positive! But most tests do not work that way – they are imperfect. So you need one more piece of information – what percentage of the time the test is wrong? It can be wrong in two ways, False positive – it can indicate you have the disease when you don’t or False negative – it can indicate you do not have the disease when you do.\nError rate of False positive – 2% (say) Error rate of False negative – 2% (say) Equipped with the above we arrive ultimately with two variable which can have binary (two states) values in each. Disease – have / have not \u0026amp; Test Result – positive / negative.\nTest Result\nDisease\n\u0026nbsp;\nPositive\nNegative\nTotals\nHave\n1\n0\n1\nHave not\n200\n9,799\n9,999\nTotals\n201\n9,799\n10,000\nFrom the above table it is easy to visualize that out of 10,000 people, 201 of them had tested positive just like yours but only 1 actually had the disease. So even after testing positive and increasing your chances from 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 201, you only have a slim (1/201 x 100) 0.49% likelihood to being ill with blurritis.\nLets extend the understanding a little further with the Miracle drug – Cholorohydroxelene! The 5% side effect rate is not atypical from real medication numbers. This means for every 201 people who take the drug only 1 of them will experience the cure (because the other did not have it in the first place) and 10 will have to suffer irresistible back itches. So if you take the drug you are 10 times more likely to suffer from it rather than to get relieved.\nNeurons that scream Safe An estimated 2.5 million men in US alone have prostate cancer and 3% of men will die from it. This number worldwide is so large that it sparked a ‘No shave November’ movement to generate awareness for it. It is the second leading cause of cancer death among men after lung cancer. Nearly every urologist who delivers the news will recommend radical surgery to remove the prostate. And of first blush it sounds reasonable too – sacrifice a small portion of your body instead and live to see more days.\nBut it is not so simple if you get to know about it. For one, it is a particularly slow - progressing cancer, most men die with it rather than of it. There is also a high incidence of recurrence following surgery. And what about the side effects? The incidence rates of side effects among patients after surgery is as follows –\nInability to maintain erections – 80% Shortening of phallus by one inch – 50% Urinary inconsistence – 35% Fecal inconsistence – 25% Hernia 17% Just reading a few out of the lot makes one feel awful. But still a lot of men when faced with the choice will go for the surgery as it is better than death. But can it be safely left untreated in men? If yes, then how many men? 47 out of 48. To put into another way, for every 48 prostate surgeries performed only 1 life is extended and the other 47 who would have lived just as long anyway, now has to suffer the side effects.\nSo then why nearly every urologist recommends the surgery? It is one of the most complicated surgeries known, is it not a good reason not to recommend it? But the fact is they have invested an enormous amount of time and money in learning it. The training required is extensive and those who have mastered it are prized for the rare skill. They are trained in removing the cancer not to look at the quality of life after. And when you are have a hammer, everything starts to look like a nail.\nNevertheless, the C word is very intimidating. It is very hard for a patient who is diagnosed with cancer to listen to the statement “We will just keep an eye on it” from the doctor, they feel they were not taken care properly. Also the fact that our brains are wired to react to Risks with greater coefficients and not rationally. This bias is called loss aversion. What if you are the 1 among the 48? Is there any telling? That’s what your neurons will scream.\nAlternative treatments In India Homeopathy is over a 1,000 crore industry with a growth rate of 15-20 % annually. It is a 19th century practice which revolves around two principles – one that the substance that actually is the cause of the disease can cure it if administered in small doses. The second belief is that diluting a substance repeatedly leave the remnants of the original substance with better ‘vibrations’ and has curative properties. The more dilute the substance, the more powerful it is.\nThe dilution though goes through a very specific procedure – the technician takes one part of the chemical substance and dilutes it with ten parts of water and then shakes it up and down ten times, back and forth ten times and side to side ten times. Then he takes one part of that solution and dilutes it in ten parts of water and repeats the shaking procedure again. The repetition is performed twenty times or so resulting in a solution which is one part of the original substance to 100,000,000,000,000,000,000 parts of water. For retail products the dilutions are routinely 1 followed by 30 zeros and often 1 followed by – get this – 1,500 zeros. This is very gargantuan number, it is like taking a grain of rice and crushing it into a fine powder and dissolving it in a sphere of water the size of our solar system – and yeah repeating that 26 times. Ever wondered why all homeopathic medicines taste same ?\nHomeopathy is not the only candidate – the Multi-vitamin industry, herbal product industry is all the same. Our body is perfectly equipped to fight a lot of common diseases on its own – it has survived generations evolving and taking some of the alternative medicines cause no effect to it. There is a reason they are called ‘alternative treatments’, if they could be proven effective they would be called just ‘Medicines’. And that is why all clinical trials go through a double blind randomized test where the people who have taken the pill must show better results than the people who have taken the fake pill. Also we have the placebo effect and it is really very strong. It is so powerful that it is the only known treatment for some migraines. If people just believed that a sugar syrup will cure them - it cured them more often then not.\nTakeaways Evaluate numbers in terms of their real-world significance. Knowing the error rates and base rates are important while making decisions. Use the four-fold table method to make decisions. Know that our instinct is to be loss averse not rational. You can have a equal partners relationship with your doctor rather than a parent – child relationship. The world is not doing that bad too, the world map was from 1969.

  "content":"There are a lot of platforms to develop a Chatbot in the market today, some where you do not even need to write a single line of code. Here is a guide of what I used to make a simple bot for my website (Update: the project has seen a sunset on Dec 2022). I have made the guide in a sequential manner of steps you need to follow while explaining a few learning along the way.\nSelecting the tools This is where a there are a lot options present. I decided to go with the Microsoft Bot Framework. It has state of the art integrations powered by Azure and a very active community who has fine polished a great deal of documentation. So here are the following things I used to make this project:\nVisual Studio 2019+ with .NetCore 3.1 Bot Emulator for testing. Azure Subscription for hosting Architecture This is very basic layout of bot infrastructure I implemented. The Bot is hosted as an independent app service, and embedded into my website. The entire setup including the Bot, Website, and other services costs me under 3000 INR per month (as of May 2020).\nInitial Setup This is what makes Microsoft Bot Framework a brilliant choice. You can get enough sample templates to get started with for nearly all the scenarios you can imagine. There is also an array of cognitive services you can consume through API offered my Microsoft.\nStep 1: Clone an appropriate template from the samples repository . I picked qnamaker-all-features from the repository. Also, setup Bot Emulator without which we cannot test it. It has all the necessary features fed into it.\nStep 2: Install the missing packages (if any) and run the bot locally. Yes, it will run straight out the box. When you run it, it will open up a static page. Somewhat like this\nTo make a conversation with the bot, you need to setup the bot emulator. Click on New Bot Configuration from the File menu and in the Endpoint URL field, enter the port your popped up browser has opened to followed by /api/messages. For example in my case it will be : localhost:3978/api/message. (See the screenshot)\nCognitive Service Cognitive service is the element that makes a Bot take commands in natural language. In my case, I am only using QnAMaker . QnAMaker is a cognitive service that adds a conversational layer of questions and answer to existing data. It forms a knowledge base in a pattern of pairs of questions and answer. It can extract data from excel sheet, website or even wiki pages. For this demo we need to build one. This is by far the most time-consuming section. In my case, I trained it QnA maker with answers in JSON format which I can use and alter the way in which they are presented.\nStep 3: Make a knowledge base using QnA maker and Publish it. The Json Schema I used here is:\n{ \u0026#34;qnaId\u0026#34;: null, // The identity field of my pairs \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: null, // Different Types in which I need to handle the respone e.g image, text, card etc. \u0026#34;content\u0026#34;: null, // The content of the reply \u0026#34;media\u0026#34;: null, // In case I wanted to add any media to my responses \u0026#34;property\u0026#34;: null // A placeholder to add any extensions that I want to implement later. Always make your code extensible. } Step 4: After publishing your knowledge base, you will get publish setting, use the setting to update your appsetting in the following fields.\n{ \u0026#34;QnAKnowledgebaseId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;7af6a72d-****-4ba8-9a81-2d7****031b0\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;QnAEndpointKey\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;e11d5c12-****-4c7c-98ca-b0e****f9f09\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;QnAEndpointHostName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://****.azurewebsites.net/qnamaker\u0026#34;, } You will have a fully functioning Bot by now, just that it will have responses in JSON format, we need to customize that.\nCustomizing All the customizing section for this Bot I have written as separate Class libraries making at as modular as possible.\nHandling Different type in response I wrote a method - ContentSelector – to handle the different ways I want to respond.\nType = Multi_Response: There is an array of response, just select any one to keep responses a bit varied. Type = Card_Response: Use the media section to render an adaptive card, which we will discuss later. Type = Image_Response: Send an image instead of text in response. I might other type and handling mechanism accordingly as I go.\nStep 5: Add a class library and write a method to handle the JSON Response for from QnA maker and parse the reply to user.\npublic static Activity getAnswer(Activity customResponse,string responseJson, IBotTelemetryClient telemetryClient) { Answers answersHolder = null; try { answersHolder = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject\u0026lt;Answers\u0026gt;(responseJson.Trim()); } catch (Exception e) { telemetryClient.TrackException(e, TelemetryMetaData.BindExceptionEvent(TelemetryKey.JsonDeserializationError,\u0026#34;QnA Answer Json to Answer Model\u0026#34;)); } switch (answersHolder.Type) { case \u0026#34;Multi_Response\u0026#34;: customResponse = MessageFactory.Text( answersHolder.Content[RandomSelector.Rand(answersHolder.Content.Count())]); break; case \u0026#34;Image_Response\u0026#34;: try { var response = customResponse.CreateReply(); response.Attachments = new List\u0026lt;Attachment\u0026gt;() { CardMaker.getCardAttachment(CardMaker.getImage_ResponseCardJson(answersHolder)) }; return response; } catch(Exception e) { telemetryClient.TrackException(e, TelemetryMetaData.BindExceptionEvent(TelemetryKey.CardRenderError, \u0026#34;Image_Response card error\u0026#34;, customResponse.Conversation.Id,responseJson)); } break; case \u0026#34;Card_Response\u0026#34;: try { var response = customResponse.CreateReply(); response.Attachments = new List\u0026lt;Attachment\u0026gt;() { CardMaker.getCardAttachment(CardMaker.getCard_ResponseCardJson(answersHolder)) }; return response; } catch(Exception e) { telemetryClient.TrackException(e, TelemetryMetaData.BindExceptionEvent(TelemetryKey.CardRenderError, \u0026#34;Card_Response card error\u0026#34;, customResponse.Conversation.Id, responseJson)); } break; default: customResponse = MessageFactory.Text(answersHolder.Content.First()); break; } return customResponse; } Step 6: Add a model class to deserialize the Json received from QnA maker into an object.\npublic class Answers { public string QnaId { get; set; } public string Type { get; set; } public IList\u0026lt;string\u0026gt; Content { get; set; } public IList\u0026lt;string\u0026gt; Media { get; set; } public string Property { get; set; } } Handling Dialog The Bot framework has a concept called Dialog to handle conversation flow. As the name states it is conversation between two entities, user and the bot. When a user starts a conversation, it enters the root dialog and then based on the response it can get directed to other dialogs. For example, your bot can do two features – book hotel and book flight tickets then you would have the root dialog pass the control the BookHotelDialog or to BookTicketDialog based on what user wants. In my case I have only one Dialog - QnAMakerBaseDialog to converse with QnAMaker service. Each Dialog on it’s own can follow a waterflow model i.e a sequence of methods a conversation has to go through.\nStep 7: Add the code to intercept he response from QnA maker and parse it according to the logic of ContentSelector. You can write this section in the DisplayQnAResult method inside QnAMakerBaseDialog class. Here is my method:\nif (stepContext.Result is List\u0026lt;QueryResult\u0026gt; response \u0026amp;\u0026amp; response.Count \u0026gt; 0) { if (!response.First().Answer.Contains(\u0026#34;{\u0026#34;)) { await stepContext.Context.SendActivityAsync(response.First().Answer, cancellationToken: cancellationToken).ConfigureAwait(false); } else { var customResponse = ContentSelector.getAnswer((stepContext.Context.Activity).CreateReply(), response.First().Answer, TelemetryClient); await stepContext.Context.SendActivityAsync(customResponse, cancellationToken: cancellationToken).ConfigureAwait(false); } } else { await stepContext.Context.SendActivityAsync(qnaDialogResponseOptions.NoAnswer, cancellationToken: cancellationToken).ConfigureAwait(false); } Adaptive Cards Adaptive cards are a fixed JSON to render in a lot of Microsoft platform tools like Bots, Teams or outlook. You can use it display card to you user. Also a welcome message is really cool.\nStep 8: Goto https://adaptivecards.io/designer/and make your card. Copy the Json into a file in your project and set the property of the file to always copy.\nStep 9: Goto QnABot.cs and the following code in the method – OnMembersAddedAsync. This is the method that gets invoked whenever a new conversation is has started, the concept draws parallel to new session in a web application.\nService The Bot Framework uses .Net core and it leverages it’s seamless Dependency Injection mechanism to the fullest. Every service is directly injected into Startup.cs . We are going to add Telemetry logging into it. Logging the conversation is a bot is a great way to find analytics on what the users are asking and whether it is showing some error or not.\n**Step 10.**1: Add instrumentation key of application insight in app setting.\n\u0026#34;ApplicationInsights\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;InstrumentationKey\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;363f85bd-****-4ee5-9ee2-5026****75ed\u0026#34; } Step 10.2: Add the following lines in Startup.cs and resolve any dependency.\n// Create the telemetry client. services.AddSingleton\u0026lt;IBotTelemetryClient, BotTelemetryClient\u0026gt;(); // Add telemetry initializer that will set the correlation context for all telemetry items. services.AddSingleton\u0026lt;ITelemetryInitializer, OperationCorrelationTelemetryInitializer\u0026gt;(); // Add telemetry initializer that sets the user ID and session ID (in addition to other bot-specific properties such as activity ID) services.AddSingleton\u0026lt;ITelemetryInitializer, TelemetryBotIdInitializer\u0026gt;(); // Add the telemetry initializer middleware services.AddSingleton\u0026lt;IMiddleware, TelemetryInitializerMiddleware\u0026gt;(); // Create the telemetry middleware to initialize telemetry gathering services.AddSingleton\u0026lt;TelemetryInitializerMiddleware\u0026gt;(); // Create the telemetry middleware (used by the telemetry initializer) to track conversation events services.AddSingleton\u0026lt;TelemetryLoggerMiddleware\u0026gt;(); Step 10.3: Change the constructor of the dialogs to use the telemetry client.\npublic RootDialog(IQnAMakerConfiguration services, IBotTelemetryClient telemetryClient) : base(\u0026#34;root\u0026#34;) { AddDialog(new QnAMakerBaseDialog(services, telemetryClient)); AddDialog(new WaterfallDialog(InitialDialog) .AddStep(InitialStepAsync)); // The initial child Dialog to run. InitialDialogId = InitialDialog; // Set the telemetry client for this and all child dialogs. this.TelemetryClient = telemetryClient; } All dialogs are derived from Component dialog, which when given a client will automatically enable basic logging. For custom events you might need to write your own methods.\nDeployment The complete source code is here : https://github.com/Shubhankar-Nath/AboutMeBot I used Azure Pipelines to deploy it to my App service. You can it by adding as an plugin from GitHub Marketplace. There are various options on how to trigger and deploy, for me whenever I merge a pull request to my master branch it will trigger a build and upon success it will also deploy the latest build. I practically never need to move out of Visual Studio to introduce any change, a developers Swiss knife!\nReferences https://discover.bot/bot-talk/guide-to-bot-frameworks/ https://dev.botframework.com/ https://github.com/microsoft/BotFramework-Emulator/releases https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/cognitive-services/ https://adaptivecards.io/ "},{

  "content":"The world has never seen a quarantine like this, it is a great time to get a crash course in genetics. How certain chemicals reactions enable life. The Gene by Siddhartha Mukherjee is a historical voyage of the science of genetics. Starting from Darwin to modern Gene sequencing technique he has portrayed the very essence of life from a biologist’s perspective. The following sections only give a bare bones outline of what he wrote in his book.\nAbiogenesis During the unworldly days of our planet, when it was filled with lava, methane, vapor, ammonia and dreadful thunders wrecked havoc, a very complex form of chemicals called nucleotide took birth out of the chaos. Some of these nucleotides formed chains that could replicate themselves. There were also other chemicals like lipids, fats that were insoluble in water and formed hollow spheres called micelles. And out of this soup through fortuitous meeting between two unlikely partners –RNAs with micelles – Genesis happened.\nThese protocells had the ability to gather simple chemicals from their environments to reproduce and maintain themselves – a process we call Metabolism. Given billions of years and the ability of carbon to make jillions of bonds the protocells evolved to form bacteria. Bacteria have specialized cell compartments that created different enzyme to metabolize from a large array of simple sugars, and even fight invasion of other bacteria. If you consider bacteria as mundane form of life, think again - deinococcus radiodurans is radiation resistant, can survive space, dehydration and extreme temperatures. From this point of view they are mightier than Dinosaurs and have been reigning since eons.\nProtein A cell’s nucleus has two forms of acid – DNA and their molecular cousin RNA both long chains of four bases with a phosphorus backbone. The four bases are adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine – abbreviated as A, G, C and T. In RNA the Thymine is switched with uracil abbreviated as U.\nJames Watson and Francis Crick won the Nobel prize in 1963, for the discovery of the Double helix structure of DNA.\rThe double helix contains two intertwined strands of DNA, incredibly thin and long. The DNA of all your cells if stretched and stacked on top of one another will be twice the diameter of the solar system. DNA is the Byte equivalent to life, all the information for making an organism is stored using DNA. A certain length of DNA that encodes a functional unit of heredity is called a Gene. Genes act as instruction set to make Protein. Proteins are long chain of amino acids that perform almost all life functions. Proteins can exist as long stretchable fibers in muscle (myosin), become globular in shape and enable chemical reactions i.e., Enzymes or bind colored chemicals and become pigments in the eye or in a flower.\nGene Three billion base pair form our DNA which contains 20,000 to 25,000 protein encoding genes form the human genome. These genes are arranged in 23 pairs of chromosomes inside the nucleus of our cell. These genes are what gives life its spectrum of functionality, a gene encodes the information of the color of your hair, a gene in a spider contains the code to make spider silk, the gene in an oak tree contains the code to make wood. Not all strand on DNA encode information, there are some filler DNAs which do not carry protein making instructions, they are called introns, this is what gives diversity in our DNA sequence. With introns, a gene can be expressed in multiple variations.\nAll the cells in our body carry the same DNA, which produces RNA or messenger chemical that instruct the ribosomes in our cells to produce proteins. Some of these proteins can turn on or off some Genes. For example in E.coli (a bacteria) it makes a glucose digesting protein and a glucose sensing protein, if the sensing protein senses(chemically determine) that there is no glucose availability, it can turn the glucose enzyme gene off and turn on the Lactose enzyme gene of to survive on lactose. This surgical turning on/off genes enables multi-cellular organism to make specialized cell out of the same DNA.\nHijacking What if the coding gets corrupted? How will the cells read and process information to sustain life? It appears that the human coding very genius, it has a gene BRCA1 located in chromosome 17 which works to repair damaged DNA. But if the repairing gene itself gets mutated; our code becomes defenseless. Mutated BRCA1 gene is very closely associated with Ovarian and Breast cancer.\nViruses are small strands of DNA enclosed in a Protein, which can get inside an organism’s DNA and change its coding. Not all viruses are harmful, certain corona-viruses live in symbiotic relation with bats, they replicate within their cells and does not kill the host but it might be deadly when it enters human cells. Retroviruses cause only small tumor in chimpanzees but in humans it causes HIV. Human cells have a self-destruct program which enables healthy functioning of our bodies. Cancer viruses change this self-destruct code and increases the longevity of the cells, the immune system gets fooled as it is not a foreign body but our own cells. The increases rate of new cells and delay the decay of old cells, causing tumors which is the killing element in cancer. It is a strange irony that cancer kills us by increasing the life of our cells.\nSome biochemicals are so complex that even the most advanced supercomputer cannot compute their cellular structure. Our current pharmacology synthesizes only 20% of all the biochemicals produced in human body. So, can we hijack our cells to make cures for ourselves? In theory yes, we could rewrite our DNA that cause diseases like Alzheimer’s, SCID and even Cancer. It is something that is yet to be seen in future. But we have ventured the turfs of gene editing. In 1955 Fredrick Sanger inserted the insulin making gene of human inside a bacterium DNA using a virus as a carrier. The bacteria read the instructions (as all life forms use the same language for DNA – A,T,G and C) and produced insulin which could be isolated and used as medicine. Sanger was awarded the Nobel prize in chemistry for synthesizing the first human protein using Recombinant DNA technology.\nEvolution The copying of the DNA when new cells are formed is always not perfect. Nature has tiny bit of error at times while replicating the DNA – this error results in mutation. Overtime the mutated DNA replicates itself and gives rise to a mutated organism – this is called variation. Suppose a mutated housefly develops a variant that can tolerate subzero temperature so when climate gets colder, the mutated houseflies who are more fit to survive the cold will have more survival rate – this is called natural selection. The variations when accumulated might give rise to a new species all together. From the protocells to humans this is how nature has evolved life – via repeated mistakes. From this point of view the creator is just a blind artist. Or is he brilliant?\n"},{

  "content":"I have written a couple of blogs on my site by now - I pick a book, try to comprehend it and share with you all of what I loved the most about it, business as usual. But this blog is different, this one is very personal! Books are not the only things you could learn from, there is a far better teacher - TIME. Time is that witty stern teacher which will never stop teaching you lessons, there is just no escaping it. Every year end we get excited to welcome the new year, we set up goals, we look forward but the year that is waving us goodbye is also the oracle, if you could just turn your gaze. But then why should you invest your time in reading my quotations? To be honest, I cannot give you a convincing answer. But based on a whim, I would say maybe reading my list gives you a map to the hidden treasures time has sowed in your path.\nPeople Humans are undeniably the most dominant species on the planet. But why? They are not the mightiest nor the smartest to ever walk on the planet. What do you think will happen if you and a gorilla are put on an isolated island? Who has a better chance of surviving? But if you put a hundred gorilla and a hundred of us, we will not only start an agricultural revolution but also domesticate the gorillas. This is what makes us most significant species on the planet, our collective strength, collective execution, collective intelligence not individual accolades. Thus, it is in the very anthropological nature of our species to be social. From our family structure, to fashion, to the idea of nation works just because we think, believe and perceive in something collectively. Humans and their relationship with each other are much more complex than gorillas but nevertheless we have one common ground - relationship make an individual stronger. Relationship make the space-time fabric in which our identity takes existence. Your relationship with your friends, family and colleagues push you to make the best version you, they keep you in check and maybe if you are fortunate enough, at times, lend you a shoulder to rest upon for all your nuisances. In a research by LinkedIn in 2017, eighty percent of high performing professionals said their professional networking is one of the most effective weapon in their arsenal.\nHere is a principle I learnt, you can use to improve your relationships – become a giver and expect nothing in return. Adam Grant, who is a professor at Warton says people behave in three of the reciprocity styles – taker, matcher and giver. Takers are highly competitive; they believe it is a dog-eat-dog situation. Givers give more than what they take, they believe the best in other people. And most people are matcher, they simply match the reciprocity style with which you will interact with them. You might argue, will it be smart to be giver in a world where you might be exploited by a taker? Yes! you will be hurt or exploited by a few takers at times, but those will be small encounters. Your yields as a giver will be far worthier than a taker in the long run. Strike meaning in every relation you have, get to know people around you better, be kind and prosperity will never leave your aid. Karma is a bitch only if you are.\nBooks Understanding. Nature has given this one ability of humans so much importance as if this was our sole purpose. Humans have the largest cortex among all primates which give us our ability to understand and function in the world. But what are we doing with this blessing? This question has scratched the inner membranes of my conscience for so long. The brain feeds on input. What will happen if instead of the episode of your sitcom, you fed it some black and white pages? You will be reborn!\nHere I was with a resolve to read to read fifty books a year. Spoilers – resolution thwarted. But it was not totally luckless. Reading a book changes the way you view the world, makes your discussions galvanizing and keeps that large cortex in best health. You cannot replace a book with a video or a blog about the topic. A writer while authoring a book needs to years of experience in the field and on top of it does research and works for months to produce the best of his / her knowledge (I do not read fiction as much).

Frankel 32 A Sense of Style Steven Pinker Here is a list of all the books I read in 2019, arranged in order. I cannot emphasize enough about cultivating a reading habit. And if you have fragile habit endurance like me, just look an external hedge to keep yourself in check – mine is writing for my blog.\nFailure Dr. Jonathan Crane famously said, “There\u0026rsquo;s nothing to fear, but fear itself!”, and since you have no idea who he is, do google him up. Failure is not as bad as it sounds like, in fact the real enemy is the fear of failure. There is no harm in failing, there is harm in not trying. Which, I am sure you know already – and so did I. But no one told how to fight that fear, right?\nThe best suggestion I can give you is to change your worldview from fixed mindset to growth mindset. Whatever traits, culpability or difficulties you have, you can overcome it if you wish to. Your growth has a parabolically increasing functional relationship with the amount of effort you put in. I was someone who was so terrible at sports that I use to be Umpire voluntarily, just to save myself from embarrassment. But when I let go of what others opinionated about me and genuinely put in some hours, I realized I am not that terrible too, it was just my mindset holding me back.\nSame goes true for what you think of others, if you are un-affectionate towards somebody, it is most probably because you do not like a certain behavior of that person. Maybe you do not like a certain Bob because all he does is talk. But that is not the totality of Bob, it is his one behavior that you do not like to put up to but most not often we end up saying ‘You should stay away from Bob’. Isolate the person and the behavior and you will hit an epiphany that world is not a bad place and there is always a hope that people can grow.\nActions If you broadly observe what your day to day actions are, it is just of sum of habits compounded. Our brain instead of spending cognitive fuel on making decisions falls back to previously made decisions and deluge us into what is called a habit loop.\nProblem phase\nSolution phase\n1. Cue\n2. Craving\n3. Response\n4. Reward\nYour phone buzzes with a new text message.\nYou want to learn the contents of the message.\nYou grab your phone and read the text.\nYou satisfy your craving to read the message. Grabbing your phone becomes associated with your phone buzzing.\nThe loop feels inescapable. But breaking out from a habit should not always be about major changes. Jeff Olson calls it the slight edge – the small disciplines that will help you fight mediocracy. Just so that you can relate more to it, I have listed a couple of tweaks I made in my life. You can pick anything that resonates with you. These small disciplines will not show instant results but when compounded it will morph to be titanic. The slight edge that makes you a sharp knife.\nHaving a slow morning: Mornings are most productive time and if you are not using for your retrospection and self improvement; you are losing out on a treasure. To have a slow morning you need to wake up early instead of rushing into autopilot. A lot of people think it to be more difficult than it actually is. What if you had a morning 7 a.m. flight to Goa? How would you plan your night?\nPicking up a hobby: To say that I have zero artistic qualities is an overstatement. But I had declared a war with mediocrity. So, I picked up the easiest and cheapest way to sketch – pens. And if you read the first line of the paragraph again and look at the compound interest, I will say – I played a royal flush (best hand in poker).\nSat, 23 March 2019\rWed, 5 June 2019\rMake Calls: Set a time aside during your weekends just to make calls. Not only to your spouse or close friends but to your distant relatives, elderly people in your life and long-lost friends. It will make you someone very hard to forget.\nObserve I kept this section at last as this is the part that is most difficult to pour into words. To observe is absurdly-meaningful, remarkably-rudimentary and cannot be expressed without bulldozing some oxymoron. Let’s look at it this way that to understand how stars work, one needs to understand the atom similarly to understand the world, one needs to understand the mind. To concur the world, you need to concur the inner. You might think that you are in control of what you are doing with your mind and body, that you are the auctoritatis, but try to silence your mind for two minutes you will realize who is in control. Ostensibly it seems to be a very easy thing but being effortless is the most difficult task. Training a monkey to be still is easier than to train your mind not to wander off.\nAnd what will we find when we really observe ourselves? The answer is best left to curiosity.\nReferences · https://www.njlifehacks.com/give-and-take-adam-grant-summary/ · https://jamesclear.com/three-steps-habit-change · https://medium.com/@nwokedi/the-slight-edge-book-review-e7c31fe8165a · https://news.linkedin.com/2017/6/eighty-percent-of-professionals-consider-networking-important-to-career-success "},{

  "content":" Factfulness, by Hans Rosling\nSo this year, I took a bold New Year Resolution: \u0026ldquo;50 Books a Year\u0026rdquo;. Pretty crazy for a Lazy guy like me! But as I was pulling through my resolution (somewhat!) my walnut sized brain found it exceedingly difficult to remember all the wisdom a book provided. So, I thought, I should at least make a note of the top five things I learnt from the book. And then a thought occurred, why not make it public? It could motivate someone to pick up a book. I cannot blog about every book I read, but this one, definitely deserves mentioning about. So this is that personal-note-made-public. My memoir-on-Display!\nThey say, no book is read twice. When you read this book, you might not find these five inferences to be the most significant.\nHow is your Factfulness? The book is on factfulness about the world, so before beginning I would like you to take a small test. I know, right? Who the hell starts a blog with a test? But trust me, go through it in a fair manner, it will be insightful.\nIn all low-income countries across the world today, how many girls finish primary school ? 20 percent 40 percent 60 percent Where does majority of the world population live? Low - income countries Middle - income countries High - income countries What is the life expectancy of the world today? 50 years 60 years 70 years How many of the world’s 1-year-old children have been vaccinated against some disease ? 20 percent 50 percent 80 percent Worldwide, 30-year-old men have spent 10 years in school, on average. How many years have women of the same age spent in school? 9 years 6 years 3 years There are roughly 7 billion people in the world today. Which configuration will represent proper distribution? Americas[1] | Europe[1] | Africa[1] | Asia Pacific[4] Americas[1] | Europe[1] | Africa[2] | Asia Pacific[3] Americas[2] | Europe[1] | Africa[1] | Asia Pacific[3] In the last 20 years the proportion of people living in extreme poverty, worldwide, has\u0026hellip;? Almost doubled Remained more or less the same Almost halved Chimpanzees are considered very smart animals. If you get three buzzers marked A , B and C and before a group of chimpanzees and read out the question, and note down as each chimpanzee’s “answer” the buzzers she hits, you would see the chimps would score 33 % on average. But how much did you score? Is your world view just distorted or just dramatically wrong?\nNote\nThe answers are: 3; 2; 3; 3; 1; 1; 3;\nWhere do you lie? When we generally talk about other nation, we talk in a sense about ‘them’ and ‘us’. Subconsciously, it just a label we have assigned nations as developing/developed, west/rest, poor/rich. Whatever the term maybe, we have clear distinction about the world in our head. But how do this pictures in our heads compare to the reality ?\nLet us check it against the data. The following chart shows babies per women and their survival rates for all countries. Each bubble represents a country on the chart, with the size of the bubble proportionate to the country’s population. The biggest bubbles are India and China. On the left there are counties where women and many babies and on the right are counties where women have fewer babies. The higher up a country is the better the child survival rate is in that country.\nLook how nicely the world’s countries fall in to the two boxes: developing and developed. We can see there is a clear gap with just a few small population countries in between. Out of 193 countries more than 120 countries fall under the developing category including two of the most populated – India and China. In the developing countries women have more than 5 children on average and not all of them survive past the age 5. On the other hand, we have developed countries where women have fewer than 3.5 children on average child survival rate above 90 percent. Is not the world simple to understand? What’s the big deal?\nThe big deal is this picture is from 1965! Here is how the same graph looks now: There world has completely changed. Look at the bottom-left, there are hardly any countries left! Eighty five percent of mankind are already inside the box of what we labeled ‘developed’. You can see this trend not only in child survival rate but in all aspect of human lives. There is no gap. But while the world has changed, the worldview has not.\nDistribution of population based on income level.\rBut we still need some sort of sorting to make sense of the world. The old labels are no longer valid but we need the labels to focus on markets, healthcare and overall development. Instead of dividing the world into two groups we can divide it into four income levels. And this is how the World Bank sees the world. Each figure in the following chart represents 1 billion people distributed across four income levels. As you can see, most people are in the middle where they have their basic needs met.\nThink of the four income levels as the levels of a computer game. Everyone wants to move upward in through the levels with the only strange thing is that Level 1 is the hardest. Let’s play\nLevel 1: You start at level 1 with less than $2 per day. Your five children spend hours walking barefoot with single plastic bucket back and forth to fetch water from a dirty mud hole. On their way back they gather firewood to prepare the same grey porridge you’ve been eating everyday for your whole life – except during the months when the meager soil yielded no crops and you went to bed hungry. One day your youngest daughter develops a nasty cough due to indoor firewood smoke, it continues for a month after which she is laid to rest because you cannot afford antibiotics. This is extreme poverty but you keep the struggle on. Some lucky season maybe your yields are good and you sell the surplus to earn more than $2 a day. Level 2 unlocked, good luck!\nWhat life looks like in level 1.\rLevel 2: You have made it! In fact, you have multiplied your income, a couple of more dollars everyday, what are you going to do with all these money ? Now you can buy food you did not grow yourself, have adequate protein. Maybe you can save some money and buy a mattress or even a bicycle, which means it takes only half the amount to get the water from a cleaner source. You can afford to use a gas stove. Most importantly you can send your children to primary public school and they can study in your home under an electric bulb. Life is much better now. But life is very uncertain here, a single illness or a natural calamity and you are back to level 1. This is how majority of the world population live. Maybe your eldest son gets a job at the local garment factory and becomes the first in generations to bring home a salary. You somehow make it to level 3.\nWhat life looks like in level 2.\rLevel 3: Wow! You really did it! You and your sons worked multiple jobs, 16 hours a day and on weekends too and you have managed to quadruple your income to more than $32 a day. You have super impressive saving skills which lets you to buy small luxuries of life. You have a tap water at your home, stable electric line and a fridge too. Your roofs do not leak. You can have different meals everyday and have forgotten what is malnutrition. You even manage to buy a motorcycle. Unfortunately, you met an accident one day, all the saving for your children’s education went into your treatment, yet you remain in the same level. Soon all of your children start earning and for the first time your family goes on a vacation.\nWhat life looks like in level 3.\rLevel 4: Your family income is quite substantial now, a couple of dollars which changed your life living in extreme poverty, now do not make any difference in your life. Your grandchildren will have more than 12 years of education on average. You can afford a flight ticket and occasionally go out for dinner. You even have water heating systems. But you already know about this level! Since you are reading this, I’m pretty sure you live in level 4. The difficulty, when you have always known this level of income is to understand the huge differences between the other three levels. People on level 4 must struggle hard not to misunderstand the reality of the rest of 6 billion people of the world.\nWhat life looks like in level 4.\rDo we know? Look at this amazing graph, do you notice the most recent dip? The plunge in global life expectancy curve in 1960 was because 15 to 60 million people (nobody is sure of the exact number) starved to death that year in China, in what was probably the world’s largest ever man-made famine. Does the name Mao ring any bells? The Chinese harvest in 1960 was smaller than planned because of a bad season combined with poor governmental advice about how to grow crops more effectively. The local government didn’t want to show the bad results, so they took all food and sent it to central government. Within a year, the starvation drove the people mad, piles of dead bodies in the street, people were even seen biting each other off. The Chinese government kept it a secret for 36 years! Could any government keep the death of 15 million people a global secret today?\nNews and Media plays a very important role in being Factful. Without the world view it will not be possible to drive our actions to the right direction. It is very hard today to keep anything secret for very long. There are over 400 TV news channels registered in India alone. But unfortunately, these news sources also act as a filter which very often makes our worldview disproportionate. During the first outbreak of swine-flu, for over a period of two weeks until a vaccine was manufactured, it killed 31 people. If you search about it, google will give you 253,442 (at the time of writing) articles about it, that is 8176 articles per death. But during the same time Tuberculosis killed 63,066 people, with only 0.1 articles per death about it. This filter diverts our attention in a unimaginably wrong way, sets a fear in our minds disproportionately.\nEight miles underwater, in the sea-floor of pacific ocean just off the coast of a japan a “seismic slip-rupture event” occurred on March 11, 2011. Tsunami. It killed 18,000 people worldwide in a matter of hours. The tsunami was also higher than the wall build to protect Fukushima nuclear power plant. The province was flood and the world’s news floated the fear of radioactive contamination. People tried to escape as fast as they could, but 1,600 more died. Not one person in the 1,600 dead, was reported to having died from any radioactivity. Those 1,600 died because they were trying to escape, mostly old people from the physical and mental stress of evacuation. It wasn’t radioactivity that killed them, it was the fear set in their mind about the radioactivity.\nBeat up your Grandma Big pharmaceutical companies hardly do any research on malaria and noting at all on sleeping sickness which affect the poorest. Should we blame the big companies like Novartis? Maybe not the who company, but the CEO? But you might argue that in such the board members decide the direction, so should we punch the board of directors? But Novartis is a public company, which means the real boss are its shareholders, the board does adhere to the priorities of the shareholders, they can just elect a new board. That’s right! We need to blame the shareholders who want this company to spend on researching rich people’s illness so that they can get a good return for their shares. So who owns the shares? The rich? No, and this is where it gets interesting. Pharma companies are known to have steady stock prices, they do not fluctuate much with the economy and is a good option for long time investment. They are mostly owned by retirement funds. So, should you punch up your grandma? And don’t you forget the money your grandma gave you that summer, maybe you should punch yourself too!\nThe Foreign Disease\nSkin is the body’s largest organ. Before medicine, one of the worst imaginable skin disease was syphilis, which will start as itchy boils and then eat its way into the bones. The microbe that caused this unbearable and disgusting pain has different names in different places. In Russia it is called the polish disease. In Poland it is called the German disease. In Germany, the French disease; and in France, the Italian disease. Italian blamed back calling it the French disease.\nWhen something goes wrong, it comes very naturally to us to blame someone. We like to believe that things happen because some individuals have power and agency otherwise the world feels uncertain. This blame instinct derails us to focus on true development. The same thing is also true when things go really well, just that we ‘claim’ instead of ‘blame’. If you want to change the world, you have to understand it, blame instinct is not going to help.\nRocks that move Africa is lagging on average from other continents. The average lifespan of a newborn baby in Africa is 65, a staggering 17 years below western Europe. But averaging whole of Africa can be misleading – Tunisia, Morocco, Egypt have life expectancy way above 72. Each of the countries south of Sahara reduced it child mortality rate faster than a European country like Sweden. In fact the most entrepreneurial country in the world is not U.S., its Uganda. Bangladesh too have suffered its share of poverty and famines but today it produces most of the clothes in your wardrobe.\nThere is an idea that innate characteristics determine the destinies of people, countries and religion and culture. We believe that things have always been this way and things will never change. It is just that the speed of cultural change versus the spread of internet is not noticeable. Societies and cultures are not like rocks, unchanging and unchangeable. They move\u0026hellip;\n"},{

  "content":"Humans appeared on earth around 200,000 years ago but most human advancements are from the last 500 years. To put things into an evolutionary perspective it is- ‘in a blink’. The earth has been united into a single mega-ecology. Humanity enjoys comforts that were fairy tales not so long ago. The Science and industrial revolutions gave us superhuman powers. Heck, it has been 50years that we landed on the moon. But, are we happier? Did the newfound ways of life, wealth, social change translate into new find contentment? Watching Netflix makes one feel more fulfilled than cavemen gazing at constellations? We came through so many revolutions, struggled to be where we are today as a race but can we say that Neil Armstrong was more happy to see the blue planet from a celestial body than the nameless Tarzan who drew a hand-print on the wall of Chauvet Cave? Perhaps it is the most important question human race could face.\nPainting in Chauvet Cave\rEverything’s amazing, nobody is happy. In 1973, the economist Richard Easterlin identified a paradox which has since been named after him – Easterlin Paradox. The study showed that within a country richer people are happier, but overtime as their countries keep getting richer their happiness does not increase. Economics cannot be a one-dimensional entity, with more money people get a better quality of life in all aspects. Economics is like a rise in tide, it raises all boats.\nWhen humans transitioned from foragers to farmers, they increased in population, but faced more infections from breeding animals, consumed a lesser spectrum of food, and individual humans grew harsher. The spread of European empires enlarged a lot of ideas, increased collective knowledge but almost eliminated entire species like the Tasmanian tiger, the Aboriginals and Native Americans.\nThe Scandinavian nation Sweden is a secular paradise. Practically speaking, the country is elite with peaks in almost all human development graphs, but it has a famously high rate of suicide.\nA larger half (55.4 %) of the world has internet access but people are getting increasingly lonelier in an increasingly crowded world. The rise in individualism, materialism, consumerism and decadent wealth seem to have left us, spiritually impoverished, eroded our traditional communities of hearty social bonds and a sense of meaning bestowed by followed religion.\nSo, should we assume that all the extra years of life and health, all that additional knowledge, leisure and breadth of experience, all those advances in peace and safety have left us lonelier and more suicidal. Are all the talks of human progress being flimsy and not reflect ground reality? If it is, it would be humanity’s greatest joke!\nGarden of Eden. Before you start walking with pots hanging around a donkey into the oblivion, let’s look at the other side of the coin. We have always complained about the delay in arrival of your luggage at the baggage carousel, haven’t we all? But really, try to wrap your head around the fact that you just sat comfortably in an air-conditioned aluminum tube and flew thousands of miles at lighting speed piercing the clouds and not only that, there exists a cabin crew ready to cater to almost all your needs and safety. And you are cribbing? You are no less than a Greek God to people who were born just few hundred years ago. Imagine being born in the Nomadic Period (8000-6000 BC \u0026hellip;ish), California to New York would have taken you thirteen years not 5 hours and with a high chance of you getting killed on the way by the heat, an animal, your own tribe or even a bacteria. If it were up to me, I would build Churches for the Wright Brothers too!\nWright Brothers\rIn 1919 no women had the right to vote but less than a hundred years later women in all democracies around the world can choose their government – except one (and no, it is not a middle eastern country). Another area where humans have made a gargantuan leap is healthcare. Even in the early 1900s, giving birth was as deadly to a woman as having Breast cancer in the 21stcentury. You might have never heard of the name – Alexander Fleming, but he has saved countless people from an untimely death. He discovered Penicillin, a broad-spectrum antibiotic. Imagine if you were born in 19thcentury and your appendix was enlarged, you would have to go through the procedure of removing it without anesthesia, that too considering you were diagnosed correctly. Today you can through the procedure on one weekend and go golfing the next.\nOn August 6, 1945 the U.S dropped a Bomb called “Little Boy” on the city of Hiroshima – what an ironical name for uranium gun-type atom bomb which killed approximately 237,000 people. Now, over 60 years later the world has nine (officially) nuclear powered nations, with Russia possessing the most destructive - Tsar (loosely, King of Bombs). The Russians nicknamed it the Kuz’kina Mat–or what roughly translates to “We’ll Show You.” And is 14 thousand times more powerful than the Little Boy. One can very sanely argue that humankind is heading for a quick extinction. But I would like to present a rather unpopular view, that possession of Nuclear weapon has made the world a more peaceful place. The last bomb scarred the mankind so bad, that we might never think of using such a weapon again. The U.S. has already disarmed two-thirds of its nuclear warheads and is using the fuel for sustainable energy generation. Perhaps the most deserving candidate to Nobel Prize is J. Robert Oppenheimer. He was in fact nominated thrice, just never for Peace.\nOn September 2000, 189 UN members came in agreement for eight goals which would pull the lowest section of the human society out of misery. They are called the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and were planned to be achieved by 2015. Each goal had specific indicators and targets to be achieved and governments of the entire planet joined hands to pull this massive operation off. I am delighted to tell you that all of the eight MDGs are achieved! With the MDG1 (to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger) being achieved five years ahead of time. Individually to us this might not be of worthy consequence but as a race, this is a tremendous feat. Now, the MDG’s successor – the Sustainable Development Goals – are due to be adopted by world leaders. If we change our view from individual perception of happiness to a collective well-being, we are truly in the Garden of Eden described in the Book of Ezekiel, just maybe with lesser vegetation.\nCounting Happiness This does not mean that individual happiness is not a factor at all, instead we should look at what makes us truly happy and how can we quantify it. Happiness has two sides – an experiential side and a cognitive side. One way to measure the cognitive side would be to simply ask the people how they are doing. People can be asked “How satisfied are you these days?”, “What is the world possible life for you?”, “How would you sum your life as a whole?”. But you will see people often find these questions very hard, this is because they are actually hard. Often these answers are blurred by recent events, weather, current mood, etc. As Daniel Kahneman in his famous book Thinking Fast and Slow wrote that when people are asked about their experience, they tend to skew their answers towards their peak memories and not the actual cumulative sum of experiences. And we are hard-wired to remember the negative experiences more intensely. So, suppose someone listens to 20 minutes of splendid symphony which ends with a long screechy sound, he/she is more likely to give a negative feedback when asked about the entire experience.\nThis brings us to the experiential component which consists of a balance between positive emotions like elation, joy, pride, delight and negative emotions like jealousy, worry and anger. To sample the experiences, we can put up a buzzer that goes off at random times and prompts people to indicate how they are feeling. The ultimate measure would be the total weighted sum of a lifetime, obviously this is not feasible.\nEarthly Virtues World Happiness report 2016 showed that the richer the country, the Happier its people are. No wonder, with money comes security and better amenities. But there is a parity, the richer the country the more additional money its people need to become happier, but the upward graph never flattens out. And countries do get richer with time, economics is not a zero-sum game. Individual happiness again here is very subjective, suppose you wanted a bicycle and you got a mini cooper; you will be in seventh heaven. The same car for a person longing for a Land Rover will bring despair. That is why Americans with very high average income is far behind the happiness ladder, even behind low average income countries like Israel.\nAs Yuval Noah Harari in his book Sapiens wrote that unlike we mostly assume, Homo Sapiens are not the most cognitively smart species to walk the earth. But why is there only one species in the entire Homo genus(principle category of species)? Because we are the most social species. One smart Homo Erectus is nothing compared to collective intelligence of a hundred Homo Sapiens. This need for social connection also contributes to our happiness. Over the time families have gotten more and more nuclear, the younger generation is plagued with loneliness. But on the other hand, we have made the world a much smaller place too, social media has connected the world in a closed knit community. People have found companions favoring the same brand of digital cameras too, you should see the Nikon versus Canon thread over Reddit.\nBut that’s not all. There are other factors which engulf our happiness. Like security, you would not want to settle your rich and happy family in Syria right? Healthcare would also be key pillar. We have progressed in a miraculous way in this field but even if we cure ourselves of all diseases, we will give ourselves an epidemic of anger and anxiety. Contrary to popular belief, suicide rates have declined drastically over centuries. But well doing countries have higher suicide rates. First world problems? Maybe it is difficult to cope if people around you are more happy.\nChemical Romance The Biologist’s perspective of happiness gives us an entire new dimension to explore. Like all mental states, our subjective happiness is not determined by external factors but fundamental Neurochemicals. Your experiences are nothing but a complex mesh of neurons firing electricity and various biochemical substance such as serotonin, dopamine and oxytocin. In this sense nobody is ever happy by winning a lottery, getting a promotion, or finding true love. They are made happy by one and one thing only -pleasure sensation on their nervous system. Unfortunately for all the hopes of creating an eutopia on Earth, our internal biochemical systems are programmed to keep the happiness level constant. From an evolutionary perspective, the natural selections have only one agenda – Survival, it could not be more bothered whether you are gloomy potato or Joey Tribbiani.\nBut evidently, evolution has not landed our case very bad. It does allow us momentary rush of pleasures. For example, it does hand out biochemical candies as a reward for progenerating our species – orgasm. Scientists compare our biochemistry to air-conditioning system, it is programmed to keep the temperature constant, even though some events can momentarily alter the temperature but it soon returns to the specific point. That’s why some people dance in the rain, some are downright miserable, complaining about everything, while others are in the grey center of the spectrum, very stoic like myself. It is just a matter of luck whether your air-conditioning is set at 45°C or 16°C.\nLet’s consider a thought experiment. If you were given an option to be submerged in a tank with electrodes attached to your brain, constantly simulating happy drugs in your brain for your lifetime without a worry, something straight out of Matrix, would you choose it? If we are chasing happiness all the time, then why not? Is it not the ultimate goal?\nTrue Bliss Experiences and evaluations are related but imperfectly. An abundance of happiness makes for a better life, but an absence of worry and sadness does not. This brings us to the final dimension of good life – life with a meaning or purpose. Happiness isn’t everything. We can face choices that makes us unhappy for the short term but make us fulfilled for a lifetime like raising a child, writing a book (blog too counts) or fighting a worthy cause. Happiness is not a surplus of pleasant over unpleasant moments. There is one ethical cognitive element that makes the difference between viewing oneself as “slaves to a baby dictator” or “lovingly nurturing a new life”. As Nietzsche put it, if you have a why to live, you can bear almost any how. A meaningful life is extremely satisfying even if it faces extreme hardships.\nIf you look at it, happiness was never a function of time, comfort, luck or situations. Happiness is not dependent on external any factor, it is impossible to find it out there. We need to change our psychology about it. I know it sounds absurdly simple and totally delusional but is this not, what all the wise men ever said? Happiness is intrinsic. Something you cannot blame the time and people around you; it is for you to attain. Only then you are truly blissful.\nBy the way, the strange title of the blog merely stands for – Happiness. I know, sounds too fancy but I did not coin it, blame Aristotle.\nReferences Factfulness by Hans Rosling Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman "},{

  "content":"XOR is one of the most interesting logical operation but it is definitive not made for encrypting. Even using the lowest of configurations in today’s computer it can be broken down easily. Nevertheless, breaking it programmatically is a very interesting thought process.\nWhen you know the key length, it is a breeze! You just have to apply a brute force algorithm to find your plain text.\nLets first cut short the brute force method: There are 256 ASCII characters but only 32 to 127 are printable. So use a combination from the printable range only will decrease the iterations significantly.\nBut how to decide programmatically when we have successfully broken the cipher?\nThat is the real catch here. For this we will some use known statistics of English corpus. Then we will devise a scoring mechanism programmatically, scoring positively whenever after XOR operation the output is satisfying the statistics and negatively when it is not. Then the one with the maximum score will be the real output. Some of them are:\nThe digraphs cj, fq, gx, hx, jf, jq, jx, jz, qb, qc, qj, qk, qx, qz, sx, vf, vj, vq, vx, wx, xj, zx never occur in english words. Punctuation makes up to 2%-3% of the text (for short messages up to 10%) The letters E,T,A,O,I,N make up around 40% of the text (those are the most frequent letters in the english language) ['the', 'and', 'have', 'that', 'for', 'you', 'with', 'say', 'this', 'they', 'but', 'his', 'from', hat', 'not', \u0026quot;n't\u0026quot;, 'she', 'what', 'their', 'can', 'who', 'get', 'would', 'her', 'make', 'about', know', 'will', 'one', 'time', 'there', 'year', 'think', 'when', 'which', 'them', 'some', 'people', 'take', 'out', 'into','just', 'see', 'him', 'your', 'come', 'could', 'now', 'than', 'like', 'other', 'how', 'then', 'its', 'out', 'two', 'more ,these', 'want', 'way', 'look', 'first', 'also', 'new', 'because', 'day', 'more', 'use', 'man', 'find', 'here', 'thing', 'give', 'many'] are the most common words.

  "content":" A ESOTERIC PEEK AT HISTORY OF RELIGION THAT SCULPTED THE HUMAN RACE IN TIME\nWhat have we done to the world? Is it God in the making of men or men is the making of God? In the momentous history of the Earth where Human reigned the planet, men have always distinguished themselves from other groups of men by appearance, habits or dialects. Today Religion is often considered as a source of disagreement, discernment and disunion. But there has been no great unifier of men other than religion. So to really have an opinion about it, we need to be familiar with it\u0026rsquo;s history.\nANIMISM Anthropologist claim animism is observably the first form of religion Humans ever practiced. It came about right at that time when humans forgot that they were once foragers and started forming settled agricultural societies. Human norms started taking into consideration the outlook and interest of plants, animals, river and fairies. The idea of something being Sacred was conceptualized.\nSuch religion were mostly remained confined to the local tribes where they were conceived. They emphasized on unique features of specific locations, climates and phenomena. In order to give meaning to a lot of things around them they had to believe in a superhuman order that regulated the place and adjust their behavior according to it. They had their own rituals, like not to hunt white-tailed foxes or never to cut a particular tree. Humans understood that they had no control over certain things around them so, started communicating and negotiating with such beings for well being. Thus gained the idea of god. Gods acted as a mediator between human and their fate. In fact much of ancient mythology was a legal contract in which humans promised their everlasting devotion to the gods in exchange of favorable conditions. The first chapter of the book of Genesis is a prime example.\nPOLYTHEISM As time passed, Human societies grew in size, they also started trading. Thus also trading the ideas of their gods. They came to a realization that their different needs were catered by different gods. Thus giving rise to a belief system of multiple Gods, also termed - Polytheism.\nPolytheism does not necessarily dispute the existence of a single almighty or governing the entire universe. In fact, most polytheist and even animist religion recognize a supreme power that stand behind their many gods. In Greek Polytheism, Zeus, Hera, Apollo and colleagues are subject to an omnipotent and all-encompassing power : Fate (aka Ananke). Nordic gods too were doomed to perish by the hands of fate in the cataclysm called Ragnarok. Hindus which by far have the largest known plethora of Gods are also not exempted, a single principle called Parmatman is known to control every individual and every phenomenon of the Human\u0026rsquo;s and the God\u0026rsquo;s world.\nBut Hindus never constructed any temple for Parmatman, Greeks never wasted any sacrifice for fate. Why?\nThey understood that if such a power exists, it will be devoid of any interest or bias. It will be inclusive of all creation, so it is pointless to ask such a power for mundane desires like rain, victory in war etc. The only reason to approach such a power would be to know the ultimate truth and leave the cycle of rebirth, in other works to attain Liberation (Moksha) or enlightenment (Nirvana). And the only way to achieve Moksha is to renounce all desires and embrace all of the creation, the good and the bad. Some Hindus, known as Sannyasis devote their whole life in uniting with Parmatman.\nHowever most Hindus are not Sannyasis, so for their mundane assistance there are specialized gods like Ganesha, Lakshmi or Saraswathi. So polytheist had no problem accepting other gods. When they conquered other lands, they did not try to convert their subjects. The Romans, Hindus, Aztecs never sent their missionaries to foreign land and they certainly did not dispatch armies for this purpose. They un-apologetically accepted the local gods and even built temples alongside them. Thus, polytheism is inherently open-minded and rarely hand laws to prosecute infidels.\nMONOTHEISM Two thousand years ago Monotheistic brainwashing have caused most westerners to see polytheism as ignorant and childish idolatry. The fundamental difference was that, they declared worshiping all other Gods as pagan.\nIt is like if the President\u0026rsquo;s office is open to you, why would you take your problems to smaller bureaucrats ?\nThey began to believe that their god was the only god, the supreme power of the universe but possessing bias and interest. Judaism for example, argued that the supreme power was specifically interested in the tiny Jewish nation in the obscure land of Israel. But the real breakthrough came with Christianity. This faith began as an esoteric Jewish sect who sought to convince other Jews that Jesus of Nazareth was their long-awaited messiah. However, one of the sect\u0026rsquo;s first leaders, Paul of Tarsus, reasoned that if the supreme power of the universe has interest and biases, and if he had bothered to incarnate himself in the flesh and to die on the cross for the salvation of humankind, then everyone should hear about it. And this argument fell on fertile ground. This movement soon captured the entire mighty Roman Empire.\nThe only god Romans long refused to tolerate was the monotheist and evangelist god of the Christians. One might assume that the fall of (so called) Paganism and rise of Christianity would be a bloody affair. But the Roman empire did not require the Christians to give up their belief provided they obeyed state laws. But Christianity is a missionary religion, they vehemently refused and rejected all attempts of compromise. In response the Romans reacted by prosecuting them. In the entire duration of 300 years from the crucifixion of Jesus to baptism of Emperor Constantine, the Romans initiated no more then four general prosecutions of Christians, and few warlords might have been involved in some anti-Christian violence on the side. This is noting compared to the violence indited by Christians, on Christians in the next 1,500 years. The theological dispute between Catholics and Protestants turned so violent that on August 23, 1572, French Catholics who stressed the importance of good action and repentance attacked French Protestants who highlighted God\u0026rsquo;s love of Mankind. In this attack, the St. Bartholomew\u0026rsquo;s Day Massacre, 5,000 to 10,000 Protestants were slaughtered on the streets in less than 24 hours. When the pope heard the news he was so overcome of joy that he organized festive prayer and commissioned Giorgio Vasari to decorate one Vatican\u0026rsquo;s rooms with a fresco. Along the same lines in Islamic world, Muharram is observed. Anyone with the idea that if all people were to follow only one religion, it will unify the World?\nPainting by François Dubois, of the Slaughter\rBut if there is this one God, why is there no order? Why is there so much Wrong?\nDUALISM Among the most popular, monotheism and polytheism there was also the advent of a new idea - Dualism. Unlike monotheism, dualism believes that evil is an independent power, neither created by God, nor subordinate to it. This explains why the universe is constant battleground of these two forces. This explains the chaos.\nBut this gives us new line of unanswered questions, if the universe is a constant battleground of good and evil, that what is the point of Creation ? Why are the Laws of nature uniform everywhere e.g. Gravity works the same earth as it is in farthest most Galaxy. Dualistic religions flourished for more than a thousand years. Some time between 1500 BC to 1000 BC, a prophet named Zoroaster was active somewhere in Central Asia. His creed which later formed Zoroastrianism saw the world as a cosmic battle between the good god Ahura Mazda and the evil god Angra Mainyu. It was the official religion of the Persian Empire(AD 224-651). During the third and fourth centuries AD, the Manichaean creed spread from China to North Africa and for a moment it appeared it would beat Christianity. But the Manichaean lost their soul to Rome, the Zoroastrians were overrun by Muslims.\nZoorastrian Temple of Fire, Iran\rBut the Dualistic belief was not all lost, e.g. the Christians adopted the idea of Satan. But how can a monotheist adhere to such beliefs? (Which by the way is nowhere to be found in the Old Testament). Humans have an amazing ability to belief in contradictions. They even went to the extent of believing that their single omnipotent - almighty God needed their help to fend of the evil powers. (Which by the way, inspired many Jihadist and Crusades).\nOn one hand where Monotheist kicked the idea of multiple Gods out the door, they whole-heartedly welcomes the ideas of holy saints, angels and even Ghosts via the window. This simultaneous avowal of different and even contradictory ideas is called Syncretism. Which is perhaps the most popular belief!\nNATURE-ISM ? All the religions discussed so-far had one common characteristic: They all believed in personification of the supernatural power. But the history of religion does not only boil down to the history of such Gods. During the first millennium BC, religion of an entire new kind began to spread through Afro-Asia. These newcomers were Jainism, Buddhism, Taoism, Epicureanism etc.\nThis creeds maintain that the superhuman order governing the world is product of natural laws rather than divine wills and whims. The most significant in such category is Buddhism. The central figure is Siddhartha Gautama, a prince who got so overwhelmed by watching the suffering around him that he left his palace and started to meditate. After six hard years of meditating he became liberated and came to be known as Buddha (the enlightened one). He arrived at the realization that suffering is not caused by misfortune or social injustice rather it is a recipe of our mind. Even people who possess a lot, want even more, even they suffer. Therefore mind is always dissatisfied and restless. The Gods can send us rain, good harvest and lucky coincident but even the greatest of Kings might be doomed in their own grief and anguish, forever chasing greater pleasures. Buddha found a way out, he taught how to feel sad without suffering, how to feel joy without craving it, using meditation. Buddhism does not deny the existence of God but if you are content with your mind, will any God be that powerful?\nNeeds no introduction\rHowever as time passed, the followers of Buddha developed sects. Some started to believe that certain creatures and beings stop them from attaining liberation so they started to worship enlightened beings, asking them for help. Asking them for those mundane things, repeating the history again.\nReferences Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari Guns, Germs and Steel by Jared Diamond "},{

  "content":"I am not going to tell you about how to meditate or what are it’s benefits. But instead let me share with you about Habits in general, any habit.\nHuman brain uses cells called Neurons for all and any cognitive ability. An average Human has around 86 billion Neurons. They are not equally distributed in the whole brain.\nThe Prefrontal cortex of the Brain has the least density (Some thousands/cm cube). It also uses the most number of Adenosine triphosphate molecules (cellular energy molecules). Basically it is not much efficient. This part of the brain gives us our decision making power, our rationality and problem solving capability. Humans have the largest Prefrontal cortex among all animals (No-brainier).\nThe more we trace back from the frontal lobe, brain density significantly increases(to about billion/cm cube). The back of the brain handles the functions which does not require much of cognitive attention. e.g. Breathing, you do not actively need to remind yourself to take the next breathe. This part of the brain is much much efficient.\nWhen you first try anything (like learn to drive), it is very cognitively exhaustive for us. We need all focus and effort in it. Remember the inefficient part of the brain? The prefrontal lobe is at job here. This does not wanna waste more energy on the task and wants you to give up. Your own rationality will fight against your will to think of some excuse to avoid or procrastinate the task.\nBut as you fight all the resistance inside your brain with your clear vision and strong determination. The resistance will eventually surrender and the task will get easier. With enough repetition, it will be a breeze (e.g. driving after years of experience). You need not think that effort-fully to complete the task. The brain shifts this task to back of the brain(The more dense and efficient part of the brain). It does this by hard-wiring the neuron structure.\nSo if you want to form any habit do not let your rationality beat you. Just get to it. Focus of one repetition at a time that is it. It gets easier.\nSimilarly if you to break a habit bring your rationality into action. Force yourself to think instead of just doing the action. Maybe pay full attention, next time when you want to smoke.\nHope this gives you new perspective in life. This was said to me in a short conversation by Azran Osman-Rani .\n"}]
